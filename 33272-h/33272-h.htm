<h2>PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<p>In the beginning was the land. It drew human life to our rich area of Fairfax County, and
sustained us for centuries before we became so self-conscious about it as to make household
language of words such as ecology and bio-degradable waste. This is where we are
at, however, and thus it is thoroughly appropriate that the publication of historical
research reports in this format, a new program for Fairfax County, should commence
with a study of the Green Spring Farm. There is no better site for an example, probably,
to illustrate the early patterns of life on the agricultural land of Fairfax County as well as
to follow the changes and pressures that have come about through war, depression, boom,
and technological change down to the present. Anyone familiar with the history of this
parcel of land, the Green Spring Farm, will be familiar with a great deal of the history of
Fairfax County&mdash;told not so much in terms of its famous and powerful people as in terms
of those who drew sustenance directly from the land.</p>
<p>This report is published under authority of the Board of Supervisors of the County of
Fairfax. It is one result of a program of historical site survey and research carried on by
the Fairfax County Division of Planning in cooperation with the Fairfax County History
Commission. The original selection of Green Spring Farm as a research topic was made
by the Fairfax County Historical Landmarks Preservation Commission, Bayard D. Evans,
Chairman, the predecessor of the present History Commission as the chief historical
agency of the County Government.</p>

following: Mr. and Mrs. John Mosby Beattie, Admiral Beverly Mosby Coleman, Mr. and
Mrs. Michael W. Straight, Mr. and Mrs. John Quast, Mrs. Victor Fahringer, Mrs. Gwen
Hempel, Mrs. Don Ritchie, and Mrs. Edith Moore Sprouse.</p>
<p>The authors also extend their thanks to the Honorable Thomas P. Chapman, former Clerk
of the Fairfax County Circuit Court, and the Honorable Franklin Gooding, present Clerk
of the Fairfax County Circuit Court, for assistance in making available court records
of the clerkships of various members of the Moss family. The Honorable George R. Rich,
Clerk of the Virginia House of Delegates and Keeper of the Rolls of the State, furnished
information on Robert Moss&#8217;s term as a Delegate from Fairfax County. Thanks are extended
to the staff of the National Archives who located and made available for examination
the military and civil service records of Fountain Beattie.</p>
<p>Many helpful suggestions on the interpretation of data concerning the history of agriculture
in Northern Virginia were provided by C. Malcolm Watkins, Chairman of the Department
of Cultural History, and John T. Schlebecker, Curator of the Division of Agriculture
and Mining of the Smithsonian Institution&#8217;s Museum of History and Technology.</p>
<p>Details of the architectural history of the mansion house were furnished by Walter
Macomber, who was in charge of the 1942 renovation, and David Condon, AIA, who
designed the additional work done in 1960. Mr. Condon also provided both information
and architectural plans for the Tobey House and the Spring House. The authors&#8217; sincere
thanks are extended to both these gentlemen.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors wish to acknowledge the efficient and valuable help that they, as
part of the county&#8217;s historical research project, received from the staff of the Fairfax
County Headquarters Library.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<p>The land has always had a special value to Virginians. Land was the first form of wealth
which the colonists knew; and it was through cultivation of the land that Virginians first
enjoyed the heady feeling of prosperity that came with the rise of their tobacco empire.
Ownership and cultivation of the land were the goals of those who indentured themselves
to come to the New World, and they were the foundations on which Jefferson placed his
reliance for the perpetuation of political freedom and economic strength for the infant
republic which emerged from the Revolution. For more than three centuries, Virginians
have associated the land with values which are both physical and spiritual.</p>
<p>Against this background, the history of Green Spring Farm serves not only as a chronicle
of the lives of three families who resided there but also as a reflection of the history of
agriculture in Northern Virginia. Green Spring Farm was not one of the great estates of
Tidewater Virginia. By the mid-eighteenth century, most of the original Northern Neck
proprietary grants had been broken up and replaced by a pattern of smaller farms whose
owners owed no allegiance to the tobacco empire and were willing to experiment with
diversified crops. Green Spring Farm illustrated this emerging pattern of agriculture; and
its first owners, John Moss and his heirs, who assembled the acreage in the 1770&#8217;s and
occupied it until 1839, were typical of the freeholder classes who took pride in their land
and in regarding themselves as farmers. Their farming raised Virginia to its position of
preeminance among the colonies and in the new nation after the Revolution.</p>
<p>Farming remained the foundation of Virginia&#8217;s economy through the nineteenth century,
although changes in the methods of husbandry and transportation, together with the
opening of farmlands in the Ohio Valley and the prairie states, had important consequences
in Virginia. These impacts were followed by the devastating years of war from
1861 to 1865. Agriculture in Northern Virginia reached its low point in the 1870&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The period of rebuilding in Northern Virginia&mdash;the &#8220;Energetic Eighties,&#8221; as one historian
has called these years&mdash;brought a revival of agriculture. Farmers who could no longer
compete in one agriculture market shifted to another where they enjoyed natural advantages.
Thus, Green Spring Farm, under the ownership of Fountain Beattie from 1878 to
1917, became chiefly an orchard and dairy farm.</p>
<p>Under the ownership of Michael Straight, from 1942 to the present (1969), Green Spring
Farm came under assault from new economic forces which drastically affected farming in
Northern Virginia and ultimately brought an end to the agricultural era there. Unlike the
changing times of earlier centuries, there was no compromise with the forces of expanding
urbanization; and, eventually, even stock farming was ended. Yet, in the twentieth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
century, as in the eighteenth and nineteenth, the farm continued to represent values
which were social as well as economic. The alert eye of a Russian writer catches some of
this value in &#8220;A Visit from Mr. Polevoy,&#8221; reproduced in the appendix, just as the inventories
of the estates of earlier owners of the farm suggest the social values which were
held in their times.</p>
<p>Green Spring Farm therefore offers insight into the lives of Virginia gentlemen of the
eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries. Its owners were men of learning according
to their times, and men of affairs. The history of the farm records many references to
occasions when it was a gathering place for colorful and talented people whose names
were notable in the arts, literature, sciences, and politics of their day. Throughout the
eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries, its owners were sought for public service
and held positions of trust and responsibility in county, state, and national governments.</p>
<p>The architectural history of Green Spring Farm parallels its chain of title. Both the structure
and interior design of its buildings have undergone numerous alterations and
remodelings. None of these changes, however, has destroyed the simple dignity of the
house, and it stands today as a symbol of the traditional strength of spirit of the Virginia
freeholder-farmer in an area which is undergoing the transition of America&#8217;s urban
revolution.</p>

<h3>I. GENTLEMAN FREEHOLDERS: THE MOSS FAMILY (1770-1835)</h3>
</div>
<p>When Green Spring Farm came into being in the middle years of the eighteenth century,
it represented the second generation of Virginia&#8217;s agriculture. By 1750, the great plantations
of the proprietor and his grantees, laid out on land cleared from the virgin forest and
planted with as much tobacco as the owner&#8217;s supplies of manpower and London credit
would allow, were disappearing. In the evolution of farming, another generation of farms
and farmers was taking over the Tidewater. Smaller in size than the great tobacco plantations,
these farms utilized a larger proportion of their acreage for crops and cultivated a
greater diversity of crops than before. For these second-generation farms, wheat and corn
for export to England and the West Indies became the principal income crops.</p>
<p>The men who assembled and worked these new farms were themselves part of a new generation
of Virginians. Many belonged to families which in 1750 could look back on more
than a century of residence in America, and they were more <ins title='Was atuned'>attuned</ins> to the problems and
potentials of the New World than those of the Old. They were the generation that successfully
brought forth a new nation in their own times and added new dimensions to
both its spirit and substances. John Moss was one of this new generation of Virginians.</p>
<p>Precisely when and how John Moss assembled the acreage that comprised Green Spring
Farm is not certain. Fairfax County land records show a purchase of land by John Moss
in September 1777, but, although this is the first connection of his name with the land of
Green Spring Farm in these records, there is reason to believe that he may have occupied
and farmed the land prior to that date. For him to have done so would have been consistent
with the practice of his times and also would be in accord with the tradition of his
present-day descendants which holds that John Moss built the mansion house at Green
Spring Farm in or about 1760.<a name='FNanchor_0001' id='FNanchor_0001'></a><a href='#Footnote_0001' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a></p>
<p>John Moss lived in this house until his death in 1809. Here he raised four sons&mdash;John,
Samuel, William, and Thomas&mdash;the last two of whom successively inherited and worked
the farm from 1809 until 1839. On the death of Thomas Moss in 1839, the farm was
sold and the proceeds of the sale were divided among his heirs.</p>

<p>In the case of John Moss, more is known of his activities in the community than of his life
as a farmer. In particular, he was a leader of the early Methodist church in Virginia. The
well-known itinerant Methodist preacher, John Littlejohn, records several visits to the
home of John Moss in Fairfax County, beginning in May 1777. Many Methodist meetings
were held at Green Spring Farm in the 1770&#8217;s and 1780&#8217;s. One, held on April 29, 1778,
led to the following interesting note:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></div>
<blockquote>
<p>At
B<sup>r</sup> Jn<sup>o</sup> Mosses, met with M<sup>r</sup>
afterward Lord Fairfax we found
our trials as to
preach<sup>g</sup>
were very similar, he is very serious but his
religion is a mystry to me. Lord help us both.<a name='FNanchor_0002' id='FNanchor_0002'></a><a href='#Footnote_0002' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, in 1787, Francis Asbury noted in his journal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Preached at Brother Mosses on 2 Chronicles XV, 12-13 on the
peoples entering into a covenant with God.<a name='FNanchor_0003' id='FNanchor_0003'></a><a href='#Footnote_0003' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems evident that during these years, John Moss&#8217;s home served as a meeting place for a
Methodist congregation which lacked a church building and was served by the occasional
visits of itinerant preachers. That the congregation grew and prospered also seems evident
from the fact that in June 1789 John Moss served as a trustee of a Methodist Episcopal
church to be built in Alexandria &#8220;just north of the Presbyterian Meeting House&#8221; (Duke
and Fairfax Streets) for the use of Reverend Thomas Cooke and Reverend Francis
Asbury.<a name='FNanchor_0004' id='FNanchor_0004'></a><a href='#Footnote_0004' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a></p>
<p>In the county community, John Moss also was one of the group of gentlemen freeholders
in whom the responsibility of power was reposed. He enjoyed the friendship and trust of
Bryan Fairfax to the extent that he witnessed and served as coexecutor of the latter&#8217;s
will,<a name='FNanchor_0005' id='FNanchor_0005'></a><a href='#Footnote_0005' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> and he was a party to several land sales and leases which involved Fairfax.<a name='FNanchor_0006' id='FNanchor_0006'></a><a href='#Footnote_0006' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a> By
these transactions, he acquired extensive lands in Loudoun County as well as land on
Dogue Creek in Fairfax County.<a name='FNanchor_0007' id='FNanchor_0007'></a><a href='#Footnote_0007' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a></p>
<p>In colonial times, he served the Crown as Commissioner of the King&#8217;s Revenue in Fairfax
County and also as a justice of the County Court.<a name='FNanchor_0008' id='FNanchor_0008'></a><a href='#Footnote_0008' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a> In the War for Independence, he
served as a captain and afterward took an active part in organizing the new government&mdash;in
particular, serving on a commission to supervise the Presidential election of 1788.
Under the new State Government, he continued to serve as the Commissioner of Revenue
for the county and a justice of the County Court. In 1796, in a law suit in Prince William
County, John Moss, then 72, was able to state that he was the oldest justice of the court
in commission at that time.<a name='FNanchor_0009' id='FNanchor_0009'></a><a href='#Footnote_0009' class='fnanchor'>[9]</a></p>
<p>Service as a justice presumably involved John Moss in a wide range of decisions affecting
the life of the county. The business of the County Court in this period was both judicial
and administrative. Minor crimes were disposed of monthly, while major crimes and civil
cases were handled in quarterly sessions.<a name='FNanchor_0010' id='FNanchor_0010'></a><a href='#Footnote_0010' class='fnanchor'>[10]</a> At these sessions, the justices also acted on
appointments, licenses for mills and ordinaries, road construction and repair, and the
levying of taxes. Most of the justices were not trained in the law, and law books were
scarce; therefore, the quality of justice and the transaction of public business were <ins title='Was fre-frequently'>frequently</ins>
leavened by reliance on common sense and experience.<a name='FNanchor_0011' id='FNanchor_0011'></a><a href='#Footnote_0011' class='fnanchor'>[11]</a></p>
<p>If gentlemen freeholders held the power of government in colonial and post-Revolutionary
Virginia, they also paid much of the cost of government. In 1786, John Moss and James
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
Wren, Gentlemen, were appointed Commissioners of the Land Tax, the large counties in
Virginia being allowed to have two such officials.<a name='FNanchor_0012' id='FNanchor_0012'></a><a href='#Footnote_0012' class='fnanchor'>[12]</a> They were responsible for maintaining
the tax book, personally calling on every person subject to taxation, and making four
lists of taxable property in the county. (One was for the Clerk of the County Court, one
for the sheriff, one for the Solicitor General, and one for the commissioner.) Annually,
they submitted a list of changes in land ownership, by sale or inheritance.<a name='FNanchor_0013' id='FNanchor_0013'></a><a href='#Footnote_0013' class='fnanchor'>[13]</a></p>
<p>For his service as a justice and as Commissioner of the Land Tax, John Moss&#8217;s compensation
came in the form of fees; he received no salary but under certain circumstances he
was reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses connected with his duties.<a name='FNanchor_0014' id='FNanchor_0014'></a><a href='#Footnote_0014' class='fnanchor'>[14]</a></p>
<p>As one of the results of the American Revolution, the Anglican church was disestablished,
and many of the welfare functions formerly performed by the parish vestry were assumed
by the Overseers of the Poor. John Moss served as an overseer, and the powers and duties
he had in this unusual office were set forth in detail in the revision of the state laws in
1792.<a name='FNanchor_0015' id='FNanchor_0015'></a><a href='#Footnote_0015' class='fnanchor'>[15]</a> Overseers could prevent the poor from moving from one county to another and
could get a warrant from any magistrate ordering the removal of a pauper back to his
former county, with a court hearing to determine residence in case of a dispute. On the
other hand, each county was obliged, through its overseers, to look after its own poor;
and if the overseers refused to provide needed relief, there could be an appeal to the
County Court.<a name='FNanchor_0016' id='FNanchor_0016'></a><a href='#Footnote_0016' class='fnanchor'>[16]</a></p>
<p>Further, they could bind out dependent children placed under their care as apprentices,
appoint collectors-for-the-poor rates, have a paid clerk, and be paid for attending meetings.
They had power to control vagrants, force fathers of bastards to contribute to their
support, and operate the county poorhouse. In 1806, they were given the power to take
over funds and endowments left in the charge of the vestries, accounting to the court
annually.<a name='FNanchor_0017' id='FNanchor_0017'></a><a href='#Footnote_0017' class='fnanchor'>[17]</a></p>
<p>John Moss served as justice of the County Court until his death, and so saw the time come
when the county courthouse was moved from Alexandria to its present site. His view of
the history of his county, state, and nation saw more than mere physical change, however,
and he was sensitive to the changing spirit of the time and place in which he lived. As to
the depth of this feeling, there is no evidence in the form of public document or speech;
but eloquent testimony comes from a simple, personal act he performed in 1795. As
recorded in a deed of manumission issued to his slaves, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I, John Moss ... being fully satisfied that it is contrary to our bill of
rights as well as to our principles and sentiments as a free people and
also contrary to common justice to hold and keep in a state of slavery
any part of our fellow men ... [release and set free at various specified
times from the date of this deed] Sarah, Nan, Harry, Maria,
Hannah, Nero, Abram, Fox, Nat, David, John, Sam, Milla and Sal....<a name='FNanchor_0018' id='FNanchor_0018'></a><a href='#Footnote_0018' class='fnanchor'>[18]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span></div>
<p>The tradition of public service which John Moss commenced was carried on by his son,
William Moss, who was appointed Clerk of the County Court in 1801. The duties of the
clerk at this time differed somewhat from those of the clerk in colonial times. As enumerated
in the general revision of the law in 1792,<a name='FNanchor_0019' id='FNanchor_0019'></a><a href='#Footnote_0019' class='fnanchor'>[19]</a> the clerk must be a resident of the
county and keep his office in the courthouse, unless ordered to do otherwise. He received
his compensation in small fees charged for performing small acts, but in a growing county
this produced a substantial income. His chief functions involved issuing licenses, warrants,
writs, and orders connected with litigation. He also took inventories, recorded legal
instruments, and kept vital statistics. Frequently, the clerk was the only officer of the
court who was in any way learned in the law, and thus his advice on the law was regularly
sought by the court. As the information he gave frequently was seasoned with experience,
he became sought after for advice on many issues and problems which reached beyond the
technical terms of the law, and his importance in the county&#8217;s government was substantial.</p>
<p>William Moss served as Clerk of the County Court for 32 years, until 1833. In 1831, he
was appointed Clerk of the Circuit Court, when that body was created by the General
Assembly, and he served in that position until 1835, the year of his death. At this time,
William Moss&#8217;s brother, Thomas, who had served as a Delegate from Fairfax County to the
Virginia General Assembly in 1828, was appointed to fill the vacancy left by William&#8217;s
death. When Thomas Moss died in 1839, his son, Alfred, was appointed Clerk but served
in that office only one month. Later, however, Alfred Moss moved from Alexandria to
Providence [Fairfax] where in 1852 he was again appointed Clerk of the Circuit Court.
He served in this capacity until 1861, at which time Civil War activities in the area disrupted
the normal conduct of county <ins title='Fixed footnote from 10'>business.<a name='FNanchor_0020' id='FNanchor_0020'></a><a href='#Footnote_0020' class='fnanchor'>[20]</a></ins> It was at this time that Alfred Moss
removed George Washington&#8217;s holographic will from Fairfax Courthouse to take it to
Richmond for safekeeping for the duration of the war. Because there was considerable
risk in getting it to Richmond, Alfred&#8217;s wife, Martha Gunnell Moss, hid it for a time in her
daughter&#8217;s home, &#8220;Evergreen,&#8221; in Fauquier County. Alfred Moss was captured and sent
to Capitol Prison, and when he was released by exchange, he took the will to a safe place.
Shortly after the war, the Fairfax County Court sent a private citizen, O. W. Hunt, to
Richmond where he found the Washington will, some other papers, and the County Seal,
which he returned to the Fairfax Courthouse where they may be seen during regular
hours of business.<a name='FNanchor_0021' id='FNanchor_0021'></a><a href='#Footnote_0021' class='fnanchor'>[21]</a></p>
<h4>AGRICULTURE IN COLONIAL VIRGINIA</h4>
<p>The lands which were assembled by John
Moss to comprise his farm were quite different from the virgin forest land that was being
opened up for cultivation in the western part of Fairfax and in Loudoun County at about
the same time. Like most of the open land below the fall line, the tract which Moss
assembled had first played a part in the tobacco civilization that had dominated the life
of Northern Virginia from 1650 to 1750.<a name='FNanchor_0022' id='FNanchor_0022'></a><a href='#Footnote_0022' class='fnanchor'>[22]</a> During the eighteenth century, tobacco
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
planters of the Virginia Tidewater had turned inland, clearing the forested area of the
Piedmont to bring virgin land into production of their crop. Their actions were the result
of many contributing causes&mdash;the tendency of tobacco to wear out the soil, the need for
timberland to supply the rising demand for barrels and hogsheads, the introduction of
new implements of husbandry, the plentiful supply of enslaved or indentured labor, and,
of course, the presence of cheap land in the western part of the county.<a name='FNanchor_0023' id='FNanchor_0023'></a><a href='#Footnote_0023' class='fnanchor'>[23]</a></p>
<p>Expansion required capital, however, and many of the Tidewater tobacco planters whose
holdings had been created through proprietary grants obtained the necessary funds by
selling off portions of their Tidewater holdings. By the middle of the eighteenth century,
few of the large land grants remained intact and what remained to the original owners was
interspersed with smaller farms and old fields gradually being taken over by scrub pine.<a name='FNanchor_0024' id='FNanchor_0024'></a><a href='#Footnote_0024' class='fnanchor'>[24]</a>
At the same time, the increase of warehouses and riverside facilities, the growth of roads
overland between the principal river landings and the gaps in the Blue Ridge Mountains,
and a steadily rising number of tradesmen and artisans setting out for themselves upon
completion of their indenture periods all combined to offer a prospect of success, if not
affluence, to one who was willing to work the land diligently and prudently.</p>
<p>Many of the small farmers of the Tidewater remained as committed to tobacco as the
great planters had been. Others turned to diversification of crops. Corn (maize) was
grown in conjunction with tobacco from the beginning of settlement in Northern Virginia
and diversification simply called for increasing its role. In the eighteenth century, wheat
was introduced as a substitute for tobacco to restore the land and gradually became
adopted in place of tobacco as a farm staple. As commercial relations with England became
more difficult after 1750, and were completely disrupted during the War for
Independence, tobacco planters in great numbers shifted to production of foodstuffs to
meet domestic demands. The description of Washington&#8217;s experience at Mount Vernon,
only a few miles distant from Green Spring Farm, may be taken as typical of that of his
neighbors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the thin topsoil that overlay the clay slopes at Mount Vernon,
George Washington grew wheat that sold in Alexandria, made ship&#8217;s
biscuit that was famous the world over&mdash;and rye that supplied his less
celebrated distillery. The increasing number of cattle accounted for
the introduction of mangel-wurzels, turnips, and other root crops in
the rotation. The soil-building virtues of peas were discovered. Beef
cattle grew in increasing numbers, and began to appear prominently
in inventories and wills. Orchards and vineyards were planted more
widely. With these developments, simultaneously with the decline of
the tobacco trade, a lively business sprang up in shipping corn, wheat,
and livestock to the West Indies....<a name='FNanchor_0025' id='FNanchor_0025'></a><a href='#Footnote_0025' class='fnanchor'>[25]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his efforts to develop methods of husbandry which would restore the fertility of the
land, Washington reflected a concern which was widespread among Virginians of his time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
and the first half of the nineteenth century. Organized efforts to promote better husbandry
through exchange of practical experience and dissemination of the results of
experimentation and invention began in the 1770&#8217;s.<a name='FNanchor_0026' id='FNanchor_0026'></a><a href='#Footnote_0026' class='fnanchor'>[26]</a> Between 1790 and 1830, hundreds
of publications on agriculture were produced<a name='FNanchor_0027' id='FNanchor_0027'></a><a href='#Footnote_0027' class='fnanchor'>[27]</a> and more than 100 inventions of agricultural
devices were patented to Virginians, among them Cyrus McCormick&#8217;s reaper, the
most influential mechanical factor in the development of American agriculture in the nineteenth
century.<a name='FNanchor_0028' id='FNanchor_0028'></a><a href='#Footnote_0028' class='fnanchor'>[28]</a> National leaders such as Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, and John
Marshall actively worked in societies which encouraged experimentation and study for
improvement of agriculture through what was called &#8220;scientific farming.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the effort to establish scientific farming came experiments in crop rotation, with use
of clovers and grasses interspersed between other crops, increased use of manure and artificial
fertilizers, better plows and methods of soil preparation, and more attention to
control of erosion. Interest in improving farm animals during this period led to introduction
of merino sheep and new breeds of mules.</p>
<p>Despite this active element in Virginia&#8217;s agricultural system, and notwithstanding the substantial
amount of intelligent and successful experimentation and publicity of results
which this element inspired, many farmers in Virginia persisted in traditional ways.
&#8220;Book farming,&#8221; as the new methods were called, was decried in favor of the familiar
ways of cultivating which were passed from father to son. This skepticism was strengthened,
also, when experiments failed&mdash;as they did in many cases&mdash;and when Virginia agriculture
suffered from economic depression along with the rest of the nation&mdash;as it did in
the years following the War of 1812.<a name='FNanchor_0029' id='FNanchor_0029'></a><a href='#Footnote_0029' class='fnanchor'>[29]</a></p>
<p>While Virginia agriculture had an equivocal or only moderately successful record of
growth from 1750 to 1830, the proponents of scientific farming could and did argue that
its value was measured in political as well as economic terms. Men like Thomas Jefferson,
James Madison, John Taylor, James Garnett, and others sincerely believed that the survival
of their way of life and that which they sought for Virginia depended on restoring
the farmer to preeminence. One historian has described their philosophy thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sincerity of their belief in the corruption of urban and the virtue
of rural living is unquestionable. They practiced as they preached.
And as they looked about them, at the long line of Virginia leaders of
the early republic and at their own modest pleasant way of life,
which some of them believed extended all the way down to their
slaves, they felt they had incontestable evidence of the rightness of
their convictions. As their soil became depleted, the hold of their
state on preeminence in everything was weakening. Restore the soil
and Virginia would be restored to her rightful preeminence. Simple,
primitive, noble, limited yet grand, thus went the conception.<a name='FNanchor_0030' id='FNanchor_0030'></a><a href='#Footnote_0030' class='fnanchor'>[30]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></div>
<h4>THE MOSS FAMILY AS FARMERS</h4>
<p>Whether John Moss and his descendants who inherited
and worked Green Spring Farm were &#8220;scientific farmers&#8221; according to the standards
of the time is not certain. Presumably they were aware of the organizations which
espoused this cause since they were active in the public life of their state and community.
They may well have read the writings of some of the scientific farming leaders of the time,
such as John Taylor, who wrote under the pseudonym, &#8220;Arator,&#8221; and whose articles on
agriculture were published in a Georgetown newspaper commencing in 1810.<a name='FNanchor_0031' id='FNanchor_0031'></a><a href='#Footnote_0031' class='fnanchor'>[31]</a></p>
<p>An inventory of the personal property of William Moss, made in connection with an
auction to settle up his estate in 1835, offers indirect evidence of the farming methods of
the Moss family. (A copy of this inventory is contained in appendix D.)</p>
<p>The lack of tobacco and tobacco processing equipment suggests that the Mosses had
abandoned this crop for production of cereal grains&mdash;wheat, oats, rye, and corn&mdash;and
possession of a mechanical wheat fan (for blowing chaff away from the grain during
threshing) indicates use of some of the most advanced labor-saving equipment of the
day.<a name='FNanchor_0032' id='FNanchor_0032'></a><a href='#Footnote_0032' class='fnanchor'>[32]</a> The number of horses, plows, and other farm machinery seems large for the size
of the farm and suggests that its cultivation must have prospered over a period of time.
Particularly significant is the number of livestock in the inventory and the types of animals&mdash;horses,
cattle, hogs, sheep, and bees. These, plus other entries, indicate that the
farm must have regularly produced beef, bacon, lard, wool, soap, honey, and beeswax,
all in quantities sufficient to provide market income. Mention of quantities of hay, oats,
and corn in the inventory suggest that in addition to cultivating cereal grains the Mosses
had a major interest in raising meat animals and in dairying.</p>
<p>Strong evidence of dairying comes from the presence of a spring house at the farm and
mention of tubs, churns, jars, crocks, strainers, and the like. They point to active dairying,
with the sale of milk, cheese, and butter in the nearby neighborhood, in Alexandria,
and possibly even points beyond.<a name='FNanchor_0033' id='FNanchor_0033'></a><a href='#Footnote_0033' class='fnanchor'>[33]</a></p>
<p>The listing of hogsheads and barrels of vinegar in the sale inventory suggests still another
facet of Green Spring Farm&#8217;s diversification. Both apple and peach orchards existed at
the time and apparently produced well.<a name='FNanchor_0034' id='FNanchor_0034'></a><a href='#Footnote_0034' class='fnanchor'>[34]</a></p>
<p>The will of John Moss and the inventories of William Moss and Thomas Moss give the
impression of a farming family which was successful in more than ordinary measure as
compared with most other Northern Virginia farmers. Their farm was described in the
notice advertising the court sale in 1839 as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brick dwelling house, 8 rooms, brick kitchen, meat house, servant&#8217;s
house, new barn and stables and other convenient outbuildings.
Apple orchard, peach orchard, also, stone spring house.<a name='FNanchor_0035' id='FNanchor_0035'></a><a href='#Footnote_0035' class='fnanchor'>[35]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></div>
<p>More revealing, perhaps, is the affidavit of Alfred Moss and Thomas Love (son and son-in-law,
respectively, of Thomas Moss) offered in connection with the court proceedings to
sell the farm as part of the settlement of Thomas Moss&#8217;s estate. They said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This tract of land is naturally a thin soil, but from a careful course of
husbandry for a number of years is now in a good state of cultivation,
the fields well enclosed by good and substantial fencing, the land not
in cultivation well taken with grass (clover and timothy), and that in
cultivation just sown down in winter grain, and the buildings in a
good state of repair, the barn and stables having been erected in the
last two or three years.<a name='FNanchor_0036' id='FNanchor_0036'></a><a href='#Footnote_0036' class='fnanchor'>[36]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the history of Green Spring Farm during its ownership by the Moss family does
not contain evidence of agricultural experimentation and leadership in scientific farming,
it seems clear, on the other hand, that John Moss and his descendants advanced with the
progress of their times and, indeed, may have been among the most progressive husbandmen
of their day. They had broken away from the pattern of farming that typified the
colonial tobacco era, and they exemplified a new and successful type of agriculture based
on careful management of the land and production for a diversified market. They were
certainly aware of the new developments and new philosophy which were growing out of
the search for the principles of scientific farming, and they accepted and used some of
those that applied to their situation.<a name='FNanchor_0037' id='FNanchor_0037'></a><a href='#Footnote_0037' class='fnanchor'>[37]</a></p>
<h4>GREEN SPRING FARM AND THE TURNPIKE ROAD</h4>
<p>The successful operation of
Green Spring Farm, like the success of numerous other farms in Northern Virginia and the
Shenandoah Valley, was closely linked to the transportation system of these areas. Tidewater
Virginia in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries relied mainly on coastal
waterways and rivers as avenues of commerce and travel. When roads appeared on maps of
Virginia in this period, they followed trails laid down by Indians who, in turn, had taken
over the game trails along the ridges of the land. Therefore, by 1750 there was only a
basic network of roadways running east-west to the passes in the Blue Ridge and north-south
to the colonial capital of Williamsburg along the Tidewater and to the Carolinas
through the Piedmont. The eighteenth century development of roads in Northern
Virginia emphasized east-west travel for the obvious reason that residents of this area saw
their future prosperity more closely linked to the rich resources and fertile lands of the
Shenandoah Valley (and through it, perhaps, to the Ohio River) than through connection
with the political capitals of the state or the great plantations of the James and York
Rivers.<a name='FNanchor_0038' id='FNanchor_0038'></a><a href='#Footnote_0038' class='fnanchor'>[38]</a></p>

<p>As Colchester and Dumfries yielded leadership in commerce to Alexandria and as Loudoun
and Fauquier Counties developed centers of commerce and seats of government at
Leesburg and Warrenton, the desire for better overland connections with Alexandria
gained strength. Public roadbuilding in this period was treated with indifference by both
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
public officials and the public at large. Theoretically carried out by levying a certain
amount of labor or materials from the freeholders of the community, the system never
produced good roads in Northern Virginia; and, in the early nineteenth century, overland
travel generally had permitted them to deteriorate to the point where both foreign and
domestic travelers commented unfavorably on them in their travel memoirs.<a name='FNanchor_0039' id='FNanchor_0039'></a><a href='#Footnote_0039' class='fnanchor'>[39]</a> Moreover,
in the 1800&#8217;s, the new state governments were in no position to provide financial support
for local public works and could offer nothing more than their moral support through
legislative approval of private roadbuilding by private turnpike companies which raised
their capital through the sale of stock and obtained their income by charging tolls for
use of the road.</p>
<p>The earliest private turnpike company charter issued by the Virginia Legislature was in
1795 for the &#8220;Fairfax and Loudoun Road&#8221; from Alexandria to the ford of Little River.
This company was never organized, but, in 1802, a somewhat more liberal charter was
given to the Little River Turnpike Company. This company&#8217;s road was completed in 1806
and immediately led to enactment in 1808 of further legislation authorizing extensions to
Fauquier Courthouse.<a name='FNanchor_0040' id='FNanchor_0040'></a><a href='#Footnote_0040' class='fnanchor'>[40]</a></p>
<p>The Little River Turnpike was located so that Fairfax Courthouse stood approximately
half way between Alexandria and the western terminus at Aldie. The courthouse thus
served as a logical landmark dividing the upper and lower segments of the road. The
turnpike traversed Green Spring Farm at a point about midway in its lower section.
Throughout the history of the road, the Moss family appears to have been deeply involved.
In 1809, William Moss was appointed and served as one of three commissioners to
advertise and receive subscriptions for stock in the company constructing the road from
the Little River Turnpike to Fauquier Courthouse.<a name='FNanchor_0041' id='FNanchor_0041'></a><a href='#Footnote_0041' class='fnanchor'>[41]</a></p>
<p>Thomas Moss served as a director of the Little River Turnpike Company and also acted as
superintendent of the lower district of the road. Financial statements of the company,
which were given in the annual reports of the State Board of Public Works, regularly
carried accounts for both the salary paid to Thomas Moss and the funds spent by him for
repair of the lower section of the road.<a name='FNanchor_0042' id='FNanchor_0042'></a><a href='#Footnote_0042' class='fnanchor'>[42]</a></p>
<h4>THE MIDCENTURY YEARS. 1840-1880</h4>
<p>The Moss family&#8217;s ownership of Green Spring
Farm ended in 1843 with the sale of the farm and division of the proceeds among the
eight heirs of Thomas Moss.<a name='FNanchor_0043' id='FNanchor_0043'></a><a href='#Footnote_0043' class='fnanchor'>[43]</a> Under the supervision of the County Court, the farm was
sold to one Thomas Sheriff, lately of Barbados. On his death, it descended to his son,
James Sheriff, who kept it until 1855 when he transferred it as part of a settlement for a
debt. Its next owner was James Benton, who held it in trust for one Hannah O&#8217;Brien of
Baltimore.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
In the first half of this period the times were generally good. Virginia agriculture grew to
new levels of prosperity, aided by the introduction of new labor-saving machinery through
inventions and the opening up of new markets for farm produce through improvements in
transportation. In such circumstances, James Sheriff&#8217;s loss of Green Spring Farm for debts
in 1855 seems likely to have been due to exceptional misfortunes or else exceptional neglect
and waste on the part of the owner. Although records of the County Court during
this period suggest that Thomas Sheriff and his son, James, were before the Bar of Justice
on numerous occasions, these references do not suffice to explain all that occurred.</p>
<p>During the second half of this period, when title to the farm was in James Benton for the
use of Hannah O&#8217;Brien, the fortunes of its owners were dictated mainly by the fortunes of
war. During the four years of hostilities, Green Spring Farm stood in the disputed ground
outside the perimeter of permanent defenses of the capital where patrols from both sides
ranged regularly by day and night. While the records of the war do not report any major
engagements at the farm, they indicate that military activity in the neighborhood frequently
placed its safety in jeopardy and obviously prevented any regular farming
operations.</p>
<p>The ultimate loss of the farm in 1878&mdash;again to be sold for debt&mdash;appears to have been the
result of imprudence in business dealings (according to local tradition, Hannah&#8217;s husband,
Matthew O&#8217;Brien, was a gambler), and inability to bring the farm back from the low state
to which it was reduced during the war years.</p>
<p>Hannah O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s interest in the farm enjoyed the special protection of a deed which
specified that the land should be free from debts, liabilities, and control of her husband,
Matthew O&#8217;Brien, and that she had power to dispose of the property by deed in her own
right.<a name='FNanchor_0044' id='FNanchor_0044'></a><a href='#Footnote_0044' class='fnanchor'>[44]</a> Subsequently, however, through ignorance or bad advice, she signed as guarantor
of a note issued by her husband; and, when default on the note occurred, she lost the
farm through court proceedings which ordered it sold for the debt.<a name='FNanchor_0045' id='FNanchor_0045'></a><a href='#Footnote_0045' class='fnanchor'>[45]</a> Thus, in 1878 the
farm was bought by Fountain Beattie.</p>

Rivers below the fall line.</p>

<p><i>Ibid.</i> Schlebecker discussed the possibility of dairying as follows: &#8220;It&#8217;s very likely he was
in the business. Now whether it was butter or cheese&mdash;butter would pay better, and he is pretty close to
Alexandria and Washington, and, for that matter, by sea to Baltimore. Butter would have been the more
attractive of the commodities; cheese would keep better, could be shipped farther and find a greater
variety of markets, but wouldn&#8217;t pay quite as well. But I don&#8217;t see evidence he was in the cheese business,
and I&#8217;d be happier if I saw more churns on the list, or if the churn were better described. One
churn would be enough if it were big enough. And it could very well be run by a sheep or a dog. You
see, he&#8217;s certainty got enough cows to be in the dairy business, willy nilly.&#8221; (Transcription of tape-recorded

<p>The wills and property inventories of members of the Moss family reveal much information
that helps reconstruct the activity on their farm. Considering the equipment used, the products
grown and processed, and the number of slaves reported, it is possible that between the 1820&#8217;s and
1850&#8217;s the farm was also engaged in breeding slaves for export to the rice and indigo plantations of
South Carolina and the cotton plantations of Alabama and Mississippi. A certain amount of this traffic
was also carried on locally.</p>
<p>U.S. Census population records compiled from 1810 through 1850 show that slaveholding
continued at a high level relative to other changing circumstances in agriculture and in the Moss
family. See census records for Fairfax County in National Archives, Microfilm Division, Microcopy Roll
68 (1810), 137 (1820), 201 (1830), 558 (1840), 942 (1850).</p>

<h3>II. ORCHARD AND DAIRY: FOUNTAIN BEATTIE (1878-1917)</h3>
</div>
<h4>NORTHERN VIRGINIA&#8217;S AGRICULTURE IN THE 1870&#8217;S</h4>
<p>By 1870, Virginia farmers
were beginning to recover from the recent war which had completely disrupted normal
agricultural activity. The effects of the war had been felt keenly in Northern Virginia
where the conflict had not been marked by many of the major battles but had nevertheless
afflicted the area with four years of constant raiding and skirmishing. The resultant
toll of horses, mules, cattle, and livestock and the dearth of farm machinery were major
handicaps facing the farmer, as were his lack of capital with which to purchase supplies
and equipment from outside his area and the general shortage of labor.<a name='FNanchor_0046' id='FNanchor_0046'></a><a href='#Footnote_0046' class='fnanchor'>[46]</a> These shortages
were overcome slowly. Some materials for beginning to rebuild the war damage were
readily available from military supplies immediately after the close of hostilities; and, in
this respect, Northern Virginia was fortunate to be within a few miles of the Union Army
supply depots in Alexandria and Washington, D.C. But, as the confused era of reconstruction
set in, the farmer was thrown mainly on his own resources of land and labor to
rebuild his fortunes.</p>
<p>Poor as his prospects might seem to be, the Northern Virginia farmer had certain advantages
that farmers in other parts of the state lacked. The farmland was by no means
barren or exhausted, although it had been worked steadily during the previous decade

<p>Moreover, agriculture in Northern Virginia had not been dominated by the plantation
system since the mid-eighteenth century. By 1870, even the great landholdings which had
been carved out of the original proprietary grants had given way to a third generation of
farms, still smaller in size and more diversified. While the owners of these Northern
Virginia farms had, in many instances, owned slaves before the war, their dependence on
this source of labor was not as critical as in other parts of Virginia&mdash;notably, the regions
where tobacco was king. Thus, when the &#8220;great political convulsion which culminated in
the disruption of the labor system of the State&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_0049' id='FNanchor_0049'></a><a href='#Footnote_0049' class='fnanchor'>[49]</a> compelled Southern farmers generally
to rebuild their system with different forms of labor and land tenure, Fairfax County
farmers found themselves able to adjust to the new circumstances with relative ease once
they were able to acquire tools and livestock. At this time, as before the war, they benefited
greatly from the presence among them of a group of thrifty and industrious farm
families who migrated from New York and New Jersey, bringing with them new energy,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
new capital, and new methods of farming from the diversified agricultural regions of the
North.<a name='FNanchor_0050' id='FNanchor_0050'></a><a href='#Footnote_0050' class='fnanchor'>[50]</a></p>
<p>In addition, there was abroad in Virginia in 1870 a strong spirit for revival of its agriculture,
looking not only to securing the advantages which scientific husbandry could bring
through restored fertility of the soil but also to realization of the Jeffersonian dream of a
strong, stable, and independent class of American yeomanry owning and working its own
land.<a name='FNanchor_0051' id='FNanchor_0051'></a><a href='#Footnote_0051' class='fnanchor'>[51]</a> Soon after the commencement of reconstruction, organizations patterned after
the various scientific farming societies of the 1830&#8217;s began to appear and agricultural
newspapers, such as <i>The Southern Farmer</i>, resumed publication and circulation in Northern
Virginia. These two sources called strongly for Virginia farmers to change their traditional
ways of farming for modern methods and modern farm implements.<a name='FNanchor_0052' id='FNanchor_0052'></a><a href='#Footnote_0052' class='fnanchor'>[52]</a> As the 1870&#8217;s
advanced, these sources were joined by the State Government, which provided a certain
amount of assistance for modernization of Virginia agriculture.<a name='FNanchor_0053' id='FNanchor_0053'></a><a href='#Footnote_0053' class='fnanchor'>[53]</a></p>
<h4>MOSBY&#8217;S LIEUTENANT</h4>
<p>It was in this setting that Fountain Beattie became the owner
of Green Spring Farm in June 1878 when he purchased the 339-acre tract through a commissioner&#8217;s
deed approved by the County Court.<a name='FNanchor_0054' id='FNanchor_0054'></a><a href='#Footnote_0054' class='fnanchor'>[54]</a></p>
<p>Fountain Beattie was the son of Colonel Robert Beattie and Pauline White Beattie of
Chilhowie in Washington County, Virginia. In 1861, he enlisted in the First Virginia
Cavalry at Abingdon and there made the acquaintance of John S. Mosby. They became
good friends, and when Mosby received his separate command, he took Beattie with
him.<a name='FNanchor_0055' id='FNanchor_0055'></a><a href='#Footnote_0055' class='fnanchor'>[55]</a> During the next three years, Beattie rode with Mosby in campaigns that crossed

</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>Whether Fountain</span> Beattie saw or visited Green Spring Farm during these rides with
Mosby&#8217;s battalion is not certain. There is reason to think he may have been in the neighborhood
because of references to engagements at such places as &#8220;Billy Gooding&#8217;s tavern
on the Little River Turnpike, 10 miles from Alexandria.&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_0057' id='FNanchor_0057'></a><a href='#Footnote_0057' class='fnanchor'>[57]</a> Moreover, he may have
heard of the farm from one of the descendants of its owners, since on one occasion he

Alexandria.<a name='FNanchor_0058' id='FNanchor_0058'></a><a href='#Footnote_0058' class='fnanchor'>[58]</a></p>
<p>Be that as it may, the region must have made a strong impression on him because, after
moving several times in the years following the war, it was in Fairfax County that Fountain
Beattie and his family finally settled. Money for the purchase of Green Spring Farm in
1878 came from Mrs. Beattie&#8217;s inheritance following the sale of &#8220;Western View,&#8221; the
homestead of her deceased parents, located in Fauquier County.<a name='FNanchor_0059' id='FNanchor_0059'></a><a href='#Footnote_0059' class='fnanchor'>[59]</a> At that time, Green
Spring Farm was available for purchase through the County Court, which had ordered it
sold to satisfy the judgment for debt against Matthew O&#8217;Brien.<a name='FNanchor_0060' id='FNanchor_0060'></a><a href='#Footnote_0060' class='fnanchor'>[60]</a></p>

<h4>ORCHARD AND DAIRY.</h4>
<p>Fountain Beattie&#8217;s selection of Green Spring Farm appears to
have been made with an eye to its proximity to the Little River Turnpike and the old
Columbia Turnpike (now Route 712). Increasingly, the farmers of the Piedmont region
of Virginia were feeling the competition of farmers in the Shenandoah Valley and outside
the state in the production of wheat and corn. This competition was made possible when
railroads connected the Valley of Virginia and the farmlands of the great midwestern
prairie states with the markets of the eastern cities. Farmers in the middle and Northern
Virginia no longer enjoyed the advantages they once had in shipping wheat and corn to
these markets.<a name='FNanchor_0061' id='FNanchor_0061'></a><a href='#Footnote_0061' class='fnanchor'>[61]</a> More and more in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, Northern
Virginia farmers planted corn, wheat, and other grains for use as livestock feed rather than
sale in the grain market.</p>

</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>Like many other</span> Fairfax County farmers, Fountain Beattie found that he was better off
to abandon diversified farming in favor of crops with respect to which he still enjoyed
natural advantages. Thus, during the last quarter of the nineteenth century, Green Spring
Farm is identified with dairy products and orchard and garden produce&mdash;all commodities
which had to be marketed the same day they were produced or picked or which could be
made into derivative products which could be easily transported to market and sold at
prices which reflected value added by processing. Transportation, however, was a key
factor. Virginia&#8217;s country roads were publicly acknowledged to be in a &#8220;lamentable condition,&#8221;
and over even the best of them travel often was impossible in wet seasons of the
year.<a name='FNanchor_0062' id='FNanchor_0062'></a><a href='#Footnote_0062' class='fnanchor'>[62]</a> In this respect, the Little River Turnpike was one of the best of Virginia&#8217;s rural
roads, having been laid out and constructed by professional engineers and maintained by
hired labor with even more care and regularity than the public roads. In Beattie&#8217;s day, as
in Moss&#8217;s time, the turnpike was the main road between Alexandria and Fairfax, the
county seat, and thence to the Valley.</p>
<p>All these considerations led Fountain Beattie to direct his main effort to expansion of
the orchards and herd of dairy cattle as rapidly as it was feasible. Year around, the farm
was a busy place, with work enough for all of the Beatties&#8217; 12 children&mdash;six boys and six
girls&mdash;as well as their parents and hired hands. Daily chores, including milking and churning,
went on all year, for the farm generally had numerous cows, horses, and mules.
There was also a certain amount of grain to be raised each year for livestock feed, and a
large vegetable garden. Fruit trees included pears, cherries, and apples in two 25-acre
orchards&mdash;one located on each side of the Turnpike&mdash;which provided the principal produce
of the farm. Farm produce was regularly marketed in Washington, Alexandria, and
local grocery stores, as well as at a roadside stand during the harvest season.<a name='FNanchor_0063' id='FNanchor_0063'></a><a href='#Footnote_0063' class='fnanchor'>[63]</a></p>

</div>
<p>The markets of Washington were only about nine miles from Green Spring Farm, but on
market days it was customary for the farm wagons of the neighborhood to be loaded and
on the road well before dawn. The Washington city wholesale market opened at 3 A.M.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
each weekday, and farmers who came there sold directly from their wagons or from stalls
to a milling crowd of brokers, wholesalers, retail grocers, hotelmen, and boardinghouse
keepers. Most produce was sold by 7 A.M. and the farmer who did not sell out by that
time generally had to sell at a sacrifice price or else remain in the market throughout the
day, selling at retail to customers who attended the market later in the day.<a name='FNanchor_0064' id='FNanchor_0064'></a><a href='#Footnote_0064' class='fnanchor'>[64]</a> With luck,
therefore, the market produce farmer from Northern Virginia might expect to be on his
way home by noon.</p>
<p>Not all of Fountain Beattie&#8217;s orchard produce, however, went to the market in this way.
The spring house on the farm contained presses, storage facilities, and other equipment
needed to make apple cider, applejack, and apple and peach brandy. Apples picked in the
ripening season were stored in large barrels until the fall and winter months, at which time
they were made into fermented or distilled beverages. According to his descendants,
Beattie operated a licensed distillery and made brandies at the farm.</p>
<p>Beattie&#8217;s livestock operations at the farm ended in tragedy one day when he returned
home to find that his barn had caught fire and been completely destroyed. The contents
of the barn, which included all of his livestock and much of the farm equipment, were
also lost. Only the horse he was riding at the time remained to start rebuilding the farm.
As matters turned out, too much had been lost; Fountain Beattie never did more than
acquire a few horses to perform the most necessary tasks. The dairy herds and field crops
were never developed to the thriving level of activity which typified the 1880&#8217;s and
1890&#8217;s.<a name='FNanchor_0065' id='FNanchor_0065'></a><a href='#Footnote_0065' class='fnanchor'>[65]</a></p>
<h4>POLITICS AND PUBLIC SERVICE</h4>
<p>The close association of Fountain Beattie and John
S. Mosby during the war years (1861-65) lasted through the years of peace that followed.
The two men apparently thought alike in political matters; and, in the election of 1872,
they campaigned for General Grant. Shortly afterward, Beattie was appointed Deputy
Collector of Internal Revenue for the Sixth District of Virginia. Following Hayes&#8217; election
as President, Mosby received an appointment as Consul in Hong Kong where he served
until 1885.<a name='FNanchor_0066' id='FNanchor_0066'></a><a href='#Footnote_0066' class='fnanchor'>[66]</a></p>
<p>Fountain Beattie&#8217;s record with the Internal Revenue Service shows that he served from
1875 to 1914 and suggests that he settled in or near Alexandria several years before he
purchased Green Spring Farm.<a name='FNanchor_0067' id='FNanchor_0067'></a><a href='#Footnote_0067' class='fnanchor'>[67]</a>  He was reappointed in 1885 following the brief return
of the Democratic Party to power under Grover Cleveland&#8217;s administration. Beattie&#8217;s
official file in the Treasury Department&#8217;s personnel records is a resume of basic statistics&mdash;dates
of appointments, promotions, oaths of office, and salaries.</p>
<p>Although Northern Virginia seemed to be little affected by events on the national and
world stage at this time, it was on the move in its own way. In Beattie&#8217;s time this region
became linked to other major regions by the coming of the Southern Railway system; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
the advent of the high-speed electric commuter train and its network of tracks commenced
the inexorable process of creating the interdependent economic unity of Northern Virginia
and Washington, D.C. These were also the years of &#8220;Jackson City&#8221; in Arlington, and the
crusade of law enforcement aimed at cleaning up this center of gambling, drinking, and
general sinfulness.<a name='FNanchor_0068' id='FNanchor_0068'></a><a href='#Footnote_0068' class='fnanchor'>[68]</a></p>
<p>For Fountain Beattie, these years of Federal service must have brought back memories of
his war years with Mosby. Although he carried on his duties as tax collector from an
office in the Alexandria Post Office, he continued to live at Green Spring Farm and he
regularly traversed roads and places he had visited as a soldier. When Mosby returned
from his tour as Consul in Hong Kong and became an attorney for the Justice Department,
he and Beattie apparently saw a great deal of each other and their friendship
extended to their families who also frequently exchanged visits. Beattie named one of
his sons after his friend, and John Mosby Beattie recalls these times with feelings of
fondness.</p>
<h4>GREEN SPRING FARM AND ANNANDALE</h4>
<p>When Beattie purchased Green Spring
Farm, the activity on the farm was oriented toward the markets of Georgetown, Alexandria,
Washington, and Baltimore. The community of Annandale, a little over two miles
up the Little River Turnpike to the west, had not yet become a center of commerce. In
1879, the map showed a post office, a toll gate, a store, a Methodist church, and a few
residences clustered at a crossroads.<a name='FNanchor_0069' id='FNanchor_0069'></a><a href='#Footnote_0069' class='fnanchor'>[69]</a> This crossroads location became increasingly
important during the last quarter of the nineteenth century; and, like other perceptive
people of the area, Fountain Beattie and his family began to swing the orientation of their
activities around from an exclusive focus on Alexandria and Washington to take part in
the growth of Fairfax County.</p>
<p>At the turn of the century, Annandale had a population of 50 people. In addition to the
toll house, church, post office, and store, the community now could list a hardware
store, lumberyard, blacksmith, farm machinery store, and sawmill.<a name='FNanchor_0070' id='FNanchor_0070'></a><a href='#Footnote_0070' class='fnanchor'>[70]</a> The sawmill was
owned by Beattie&#8217;s son and namesake, Fountain Beattie, and presumably was operated as
a family enterprise in the same manner as the farm.</p>

farms in Virginia and West Virginia combined was only two-thirds of what it was in Virginia in 1860,
while the value of livestock in the two states was only four-fifths of that in Virginia in 1860. Not until
1880 did the number of cattle and not until after the turn of the century did the number of swine in
Virginia and West Virginia equal the number in the Old Dominion before the war.&#8221;</p>

<p>See also the <i>Report of the Commissioner of Agriculture</i>, 1870, p. 291, which states &#8220;a
striking mark of progress is the change of the policy of the planters toward the outside world. Formerly
they were indisposed to encourage immigration from other States. There was, therefore, no accession to
the population of the rural district from abroad. The same traditions and habits descended from father
to son through successive generations. Now all this is altered. Strangers from every State and every
country are cordially welcomed whenever they show any disposition to become permanent settlers and
industrious citizens. The consequence is that in many counties a strong tide of immigration is setting in,
bearing with it improved stock and better implements, which cannot fail to impart a healthy impulse to
improvement.&#8221;</p>

<p>W. Fullerton, <i>Address to Piedmont Agricultural Society</i>, October 18, 1876. Speaking to
the Society in 1867, William Fullerton of New York chided Virginians by asserting that &#8220;there is no
other calling in life in which there is manifested such an indifference to new discoveries, as is seen among
the tillers of the soil. If a mechanic or manufacturer should in like manner fail to avail himself of improved
implements or machinery, he would be compelled to relinquish his business. It is the farmer
alone who resists anything new appertaining to his calling. This arises mainly from a deep-seated prejudice
to what is called scientific or book farming.&#8221;</p>
<p>See also Moger, <i>Rebuilding</i>, p. 54, citing the fact that farmers in the area of diversified
agriculture, such as Northern Virginia, had the highest number of agricultural clubs, farm newspaper subscriptions,
etc., of all areas in Virginia.</p>

There was almost a mutiny as the men piled them up in front of the captain&#8217;s tent and refused to wear
them&mdash;all except Mosby and Beattie. Mosby then states, &#8220;I do not think any clothes I ever wore did me
more service than these. When I became a commander, I made Beattie a lieutenant.&#8221;</p>

<h3>III. THE END OF THE FARMING ERA: MICHAEL STRAIGHT (1942-1969)</h3>
</div>
<p>Fountain Beattie sold Green Spring Farm in 1917. Annie Hathaway Beattie had died the
year before, after they had moved from the farm to a house in Alexandria.<a name='FNanchor_0071' id='FNanchor_0071'></a><a href='#Footnote_0071' class='fnanchor'>[71]</a> Beattie&#8217;s deed
to George R. Sims of Florida is dated January 23, 1917, and conveyed the entire tract of
339 acres.<a name='FNanchor_0072' id='FNanchor_0072'></a><a href='#Footnote_0072' class='fnanchor'>[72]</a> Ownership changed again in 1922, 1924, and 1931,<a name='FNanchor_0073' id='FNanchor_0073'></a><a href='#Footnote_0073' class='fnanchor'>[73]</a> and ultimately led to
the subdivision of the tract into smaller parcels. In 1942, one of these parcels, containing
the farmhouse and the principal related buildings, was purchased by Michael and Belinda
Straight.<a name='FNanchor_0074' id='FNanchor_0074'></a><a href='#Footnote_0074' class='fnanchor'>[74]</a></p>
<p>The Straights did not occupy the main farmhouse immediately but set about having
certain changes made in the interior design and structure. These were completed late in
1942, and the family moved from the cottage to the main house.<a name='FNanchor_0075' id='FNanchor_0075'></a><a href='#Footnote_0075' class='fnanchor'>[75]</a> A few months later, in
January 1943, their occupancy was interrupted as Michael Straight was called to service
in the U.S. Army Air Force; and, during World War II, the house was occupied by tenants.
The Straights returned to Northern Virginia in 1948 and took up residence at the farmhouse
from that time until they moved to Georgetown in 1965.</p>
<p>Upon their return to the farm in 1948, they also began to restore and redesign the grounds
surrounding the farmhouse. During the 1920&#8217;s, when the farm was owned by Frederick
Segesserman, a great many boxwoods had been planted. They had been raised for sale,
and in 1948 the pattern of their location on the grounds was erratic. Therefore, in 1948,
a new landscape plan was worked out by Mrs. Max Farrand, a friend of the Straights and
the designer of the gardens at Dumbarton Oaks in Georgetown. Under her supervision,
the boxwoods were transplanted into a great semicircle behind the house, the level of the
lawn was raised, and retaining walls were placed at several points. This area comprised the
farm&#8217;s only formal garden; but, in addition, extensive plantings of white pine were placed
as a screen between the house and the road, and the grounds surrounding the house were
planted with a variety of trees and shrubs, including hemlocks, cherries, and crabapples,
and later, lilacs, azaleas, and rhododendron.</p>
<p>During the years the Straights lived at the farm, farming operations consisted of the raising
of Hereford cattle. Purchasing yearlings in the markets of the lower Shenandoah Valley
near Winchester, they kept this stock at the farm for fattening and resale as two-year-old
beef cattle.<a name='FNanchor_0076' id='FNanchor_0076'></a><a href='#Footnote_0076' class='fnanchor'>[76]</a></p>
<p>A variety of other animals were kept on the farm, but these were mainly pets of the
children.<a name='FNanchor_0077' id='FNanchor_0077'></a><a href='#Footnote_0077' class='fnanchor'>[77]</a> In addition to their horses and dogs, certain of the Straights&#8217; animals acquired
reputations of extraordinary extent. In particular were a goat which was presented to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
Straights by the author and journalist Eric <ins title='Added missing footnote reference'>Sevareid,<a name='FNanchor_0078' id='FNanchor_0078'></a><a href='#Footnote_0078' class='fnanchor'>[78]</a></ins> a mule acquired from the Alexandria
SPCA, and a flock of Canada geese which eventually became the subject of a special bulletin
by the Audubon Society to prevent local naturalists from erroneously reporting them
as migrants.<a name='FNanchor_0079' id='FNanchor_0079'></a><a href='#Footnote_0079' class='fnanchor'>[79]</a></p>
<p>During these years of residence at Green Spring Farm, Michael Straight served as editor
and publisher of <i>The New Republic</i> magazine, wrote three books, and served on the governing
boards of several organizations active in international affairs.<a name='FNanchor_0080' id='FNanchor_0080'></a><a href='#Footnote_0080' class='fnanchor'>[80]</a> These activities
brought to the farm many visitors whose accomplishments in politics, literature, science,
and the arts were nationally and internationally recognized. Some of the distinguished
visitors to Green Spring Farm during these years included scientists Julian Huxley and
Leo Szilard, authors Aldous Huxley and Saul Bellow, poet Dylan Thomas, Supreme Court
Justice Hugo Black, and political leader Hubert Humphrey. The farm also was a visiting
place for distinguished journalists from all parts of the United States and many foreign
countries, including Soviet Russia, when they came to Washington. An account of one of
these visits, written by one of the foreign journalists, is set forth in appendix G.<a name='FNanchor_0081' id='FNanchor_0081'></a><a href='#Footnote_0081' class='fnanchor'>[81]</a></p>
<p>The farm became well known in the community of which it was a part as it was the scene
of numerous festive community gatherings when the neighbors from the immediate area
joined the Straights and their guests to celebrate such special events and holidays as the
Fourth of July and to enjoy dinner, games, and discussions under the trees.</p>
<p>With the departure of the Straights, active farming operations ceased. During their occupancy,
fundamental changes in the character of Northern Virginia&#8217;s development brought
the era of farming to an end and ushered in an era in which this region became part of the
social and economic system centered in Washington. Intensive subdivision and establishment
of commercial service facilities became the highest and best uses of the land as population
growth in the National Capital area rose at a rate which led other parts of the
United States. Outsiders moving into Northern Virginia and Washington residents seeking
to move from the central city into the outskirts filled up the open spaces of Fairfax
County at a rate of over 1,000 new residents per month.<a name='FNanchor_0082' id='FNanchor_0082'></a><a href='#Footnote_0082' class='fnanchor'>[82]</a></p>
<p>Along with the temptation of high land prices, rising taxes added to the pressure on the
farmer to &#8220;sell out&#8221; to the land developer. It was said, with much truth, that one could
not afford to be a farmer in Fairfax County as the 1950&#8217;s ended and the 1960&#8217;s began.
For the 33 acres and buildings on Green Spring Farm, as for many other residences, taxes
rose sharply. In 1943, the farm was evaluated at $7,819, and the tax bill was $194.69; by
1960, the evaluation was $36,050, and the taxes $1,351.88.<a name='FNanchor_0083' id='FNanchor_0083'></a><a href='#Footnote_0083' class='fnanchor'>[83]</a></p>
<p>So, gradually, Green Spring Farm became an island of open space in a sea of houses and
highways. The Little River Turnpike (Route 236) was widened and modernized in 1959.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
In 1948, this road had been an 18-foot-wide, two lane black-top roadway. Twenty years
later, it had been transformed into a 106-foot-wide, four-lane dual highway, much of
which was lined with concrete curbs and gutters to accommodate roadside commercial
or residential development. The old turnpike had been redesigned and, in the late 1960&#8217;s,
carried over 26,000 vehicles per day.<a name='FNanchor_0084' id='FNanchor_0084'></a><a href='#Footnote_0084' class='fnanchor'>[84]</a> Its function as a major interregional artery of
transportation had been taken over by others, leaving to it a new role as a major connector
in the network of roads and streets serving primarily local traffic. In contrast to earlier
times when proximity to the road was to be desired, the attractiveness of the farmhouse
in the 1960&#8217;s was enhanced by its surrounding space which furnished a shield from the
highway and a setting for its activity.</p>

<h2>ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION: THE MANSION HOUSE</h2>
</div>
<h3>GENERAL SETTING</h3>
<p>Green Spring Farm is located in Mason Magisterial District,
approximately one-eighth mile north of Little River Turnpike and one-eighth mile east of
Braddock Road. Via the Little River Turnpike, the farm is approximately six miles west
of Alexandria and approximately two miles east of Annandale.</p>
<p>The terrain in the vicinity of the farm is mainly flat, with some very gentle rolling areas.
It is well watered, being crossed by Turkey Cock Run. During 1946-50, three ponds were
dug in back of the house. They are spring-fed, and their runoff drains into Turkey Cock
Run. With the original forest cover cleared off at least 200 years ago, the present clusters
of pine and oak, and the incidence of hemlock, cherry, crabapple, and other flowering
species, represent a reforestation several generations removed from the original, and, in
other instances, the landscaping done by the Straights in the late 1940&#8217;s.</p>
<h3>HOUSE SITE</h3>
<p>The mansion house faces south and is connected with the Little River
Turnpike by a black-top (asphalt-surfaced) road which passes on the west side of the
house and runs north to Braddock Road. Inside the post and rail fence, alongside this
road, the driveway up to the house is lined with trees, and the yard in front of the house
is open and flat. Between the lawn and the road, a line of cedars in the fence row serves
as a screen.</p>
<p>The back (north side) of the house faces a semicircular open grass lawn, bordered with
hedges which provide both a screen for the lawn and a background for several stone carvings
and cement castings which decorate a lawn approximately 1,500 square feet in size.
At the northeast corner of this open space is located the log cabin; beyond the log cabin,
approximately 110 feet in a northeasterly direction, is the barn, which is converted into
living quarters.<a name='FNanchor_0085' id='FNanchor_0085'></a><a href='#Footnote_0085' class='fnanchor'>[85]</a></p>
<p>Northwest of the main house, facing on Green Spring Road, is the spring house. Originally
built over a series of natural springs in order to have water for cooling dairy products,
this stone house was converted into a small dwelling house by the Straights in 1942.</p>
<h3>GENERAL ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN AND HISTORY</h3>
<p>In its present condition, the
mansion house at Green Spring Farm cannot be considered to represent any particular
period of American architecture. The original core of the building illustrates a design
which was typical of the colonial era in Tidewater Virginia. This portion of the house is
of brick construction, two stories plus attic and cellar, with the rooms in each end of the
house separated by a center hallway. Large chimneys at each end of the house made
possible heating by fireplaces in each room.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></div>
<p>It seems probable that this structure formed the core of the mansion house when it was
occupied by the Moss family (1770&#8217;s to 1835). To this core, various outbuildings and
dependencies were added; a separate cookhouse or kitchen annex to the main house was
one of these related structures, as were the family&#8217;s sanitary facilities. Clothes washing,
churning, candlemaking, and various other household tasks were also performed in separate
buildings. No direct evidence of the appearance of the main house or the various
related outbuildings has been discovered; some inferences about these matters may be
drawn from the inventory of personal property sold from the farm at auction in 1835 and
a drawing of the house on an 1840 survey (figure 2).</p>
<p>Photographs of the south side of the house show the building as it appeared in 1885
(figure 5). At this time, a one-story porch had been built across the entire length of the
front. The entry into the house across this porch was open, but on each side of the front
door the porch was enclosed, making small rooms approximately 9 by 12 feet in size.
From each room a door opened out onto the porch. The porch was roofed with sheet
metal, and carved wooden brackets were in the corners of the center section (figure 5).
A sidewalk led from the entrance in the center of the ivy-covered front porch straight
across the spacious, shaded lawn.</p>
<p>Photographs in 1936 show the front porch removed but with clear signs of its recent
presence showing in the whitewash on the front wall of the house (figure 7). At this time,
the roof of the main house was sheet metal in place of the earlier use of shingles. However,
shingles still constituted the roofing of the dependency on the east end of the house.</p>
<p>The 1885 photographs show a one-story brick addition on the east end of the house. This
was a kitchen, built sometime after the main portion of the house but still probably in the
first half of the nineteenth century. The notice of sale of the farm following Thomas
Moss&#8217;s death in 1835 speaks of &#8220;a Brick Dwelling, containing eight rooms, Brick Kitchen,
Meat House, Servants&#8217; House, ...&#8221; and other farm and outbuildings.<a name='FNanchor_0086' id='FNanchor_0086'></a><a href='#Footnote_0086' class='fnanchor'>[86]</a> Of all the buildings
mentioned in this notice, the kitchen appears to be the most logical and appropriate use
for this addition. Later occupants of the house (1880-1917) used this wing for a kitchen
and describe it as not only the center for preparation of food but for numerous other
household activities, such as candlemaking.<a name='FNanchor_0087' id='FNanchor_0087'></a><a href='#Footnote_0087' class='fnanchor'>[87]</a></p>
<p>The arrangement of rooms during the nineteenth century is not known with certainty.
The 1839 reference to eight rooms suggests that as originally built the house had four
rooms on each floor, with perhaps no effort to use the attic as living space, at least until
the time of Fountain Beattie who added dormers to the attic and used this top floor to
help accommodate his large family. This inference is strengthened by the fact that prior
to the 1940&#8217;s the central core of the house was laid out in this manner.</p>

<p>The major renovation of the house in the early 1940&#8217;s was planned and carried out by
Walter Macomber and resulted in the addition of a wing on the west end of the central
block (in which a new kitchen was installed), conversion of the old kitchen wing on the
east end of the central core into a living room with a small sunporch attached, rearrangement
of the stairways and central hallway, and certain other interior changes. This
involved removal of substantial amounts of the original materials in the house and replacement
by material considered to be suitable in terms of age and texture. These changes are
reflected in the exterior appearance and interior room arrangement of the house at the
present time.</p>
<p>Further structural changes were made in 1960. At this time it was discovered that the
second floor was sagging because of the removal of bearing walls in 1942 when the first
floor was converted from four rooms into two.<a name='FNanchor_0088' id='FNanchor_0088'></a><a href='#Footnote_0088' class='fnanchor'>[88]</a> This situation was corrected by pouring
concrete footings in the basement and setting in them a series of steel columns. These
columns ran up through the wall on the west side of the central hallway and were topped
by a steel beam running the width of the house. The joists for the second floor were
anchored in this new beam.<a name='FNanchor_0089' id='FNanchor_0089'></a><a href='#Footnote_0089' class='fnanchor'>[89]</a></p>
<p>At the same time this structural reinforcement was being added, several closets, cabinets,
and bookcases were built into the rooms on the second floor and attic, making use of
space under the eaves.</p>
<p>The remodeling done in 1960 was designed and supervised by Keyes, Lethbridge &amp;
Condon, Washington architects.</p>
<p>At the present time, the exterior fabric appears to be sound and well maintained. On the
interior, a certain amount of deterioration is evidenced in the looseness of the joints in the
flooring and stairs and in the uneven settling of door frames in the original portion of the
house. The grounds adjacent to the house are in good condition and appear to be well
maintained.</p>
<h3>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION&mdash;EXTERIOR.</h3>
<p><i>Overall Dimensions.</i> Width: 78 feet by 25 feet in central section, and 20 feet in wings.
Height: central section, two and one-half stories; wings, one and one-half stories; sunporch,
one story.</p>
<p><i>Foundations.</i> The central section of the house stands on brick foundations which are
carried up through the basement walls.</p>
<p>A brick wall extending upward to the second floor divides the basement into two sections
and served as part of the original foundations. In the basement, a series of arches in this
wall permitted passage between the two sections. In 1960, the upper portions of this wall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
were found to have deteriorated to the point that it was necessary to pour concrete footings
in the basement and erect a series of steel columns up through the wall to relieve it
from bearing the weight of the second-floor beams and floor joists.</p>
<p>The east wing (present living room, former kitchen) rests on brick foundations, with the
present wooden flooring laid over the original cobblestone floor of the old kitchen. The
west wing (present kitchen) rests on concrete footings and slab at grade.</p>
<p><i>Wall Construction.</i> Walls are constructed of medium red brick (3 by 9 by 12 inches),
using the following bonds: central block front&mdash;Flemish bond; central block rear&mdash;English
bond; central block end walls&mdash;English bond; east wing&mdash;American or common bond, with
seven courses of stretchers to each course of headers; west wing&mdash;American or common
bond, with six courses of stretchers to each course of headers.</p>
<p><i>Chimneys.</i> Interior brick chimneys are located in the center of the east and west ends of
the central block. These chimneys have separate flues for four fireplaces (two each on the
first and second floors) and measure 5 feet by 2 feet 8 inches. Three courses of brick are
corbelled to make the capping of the chimneys.</p>
<p>The end walls of the east and west wings of the house also each have an interior chimney
centered in the wall. The chimney in the east wing, measuring 3 feet by 1 foot 8 inches
and having three courses of brick corbelled for a capping, was used for the fireplace in the
old kitchen which occupied that part of the house prior to 1942.</p>
<p><i>Doors and Doorways.</i> The front doorway is inset (1 foot 8 inches) in an entrance faced
with white painted wooden panels. The entrance is framed by a plain triangular pediment
and pilasters without decorations on either shafts or capitals. The front door is a six-panel
door, designed to harmonize with the interior doors which are originals. Over the
door is a four-light rectangular transom.</p>
<p>The rear entrance is a 6 by 8-foot portico, built up three steps from ground level. Along
the sides of the portico are 3-foot railings, inside of which are wooden boxes which serve
both as storage boxes and as seats. The portico roof is supported by wooden Doric columns
set at its outer edges, and the front end of the roof is a plain triangular pediment.
The rear doorway has a transom and door similar to the front doorway.</p>
<p>The kitchen door opens onto a 4 by 4-foot wooden porch with railing and three steps to
ground level.</p>
<p>The sunporch door has interchangeable screen and glass panels for winter and summer use
and opens on the front of the house at ground level.</p>
<p><i>Windows and Shutters.</i> In the central block, the front doorway is flanked by French
windows, with 12-over-9 lights in double-hung wooden sash. The rear windows on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
first floor are 9-over-9 lights in double-hung wooden sash. Windows on the second floor
front and rear sides are 6-over-6 lights in double-hung wooden sash, as are the dormer
windows and gable end windows. The windows on the first and second floors of the
central block have 2-foot 10-inch wooden sills and full-length louvered shutters hung on
pintles (two on each side of the window frame). Window frames, sills, and muntins are
painted dark green.</p>
<p>In the east and west wings of the house, the front windows are 6-over-6 lights in double-hung
wooden sash. The rear window in the east wing (living room) has a dead-light picture
window (6 by 4 feet) flanked by windows with 6-over-9 lights in double-hung wooden
sash. Window frames, sills, and muntins are white, and full-length wooden shutters are
dark green.</p>
<p>In the brickwork of the house, flat arches have been laid over all of the windows on the
first floor, except over the windows on the rear of the central block.</p>
<p>The sunporch on the east end of the house is of frame construction and has nine windows
(2½
by 5 feet) on three sides.</p>
<p><i>Roof.</i> Photographs taken about 1900 show the house with an enclosed porch across the
front and a sheet metal roof on the porch. In contrast, the central block of the house and
the kitchen (east) wing have shingled roofs (figure 5). Photographs in 1936 show the
central portion of the house with a sheet metal roof (figure 7). In 1942, the roofing on
all parts of the house was replaced with specially made concrete shingles, which are still in
place.<a name='FNanchor_0090' id='FNanchor_0090'></a><a href='#Footnote_0090' class='fnanchor'>[90]</a></p>
<p>The roof is a simple medium-pitched roof with plain gable ends. Interior chimneys are
centered in each end of the center section and in the east end of the living room (former
kitchen) wing.</p>
<p>Full-length copper gutters are incorporated into the eaves and project approximately six
inches above and beyond the cornice.</p>
<p>Cornices on the front and rear of the center section of the house are composed of dentils,
running approximately three segments per foot. Identical plain wooden cornices are used
on the front and rear of the two wings of the house.</p>
<p>Each wing has one dormer centered in the front and two on the rear sides of the roof. The
center section of the house has three dormers on the front side of the roof. All dormers
have a single window, consisting of 6-over-6 lights, set vertically in the front face. All
dormers have beaded ship-lap siding laid parallel to the pitched roof. This latter feature
appears to be a change made in 1942 since photographs of the house in 1885 and 1936
show the siding on the dormers laid parallel to the ground.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></div>
<p><i>Enclosures.</i> A post and rail fence stands at the edge of the front lawn and, together with a
line of hemlocks growing immediately inside the fence, forms a screen between the house
and the entrance road leading in from the Little River Turnpike. In the rear, a semicircular
screen of boxwood frames the lawn.</p>
<h3>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION&mdash;INTERIOR.</h3>
<p><i>Central Block.</i> The central block of the house, comprising the portion which was built
first (possibly as early as 1760), is laid out on the traditional pattern used by many
colonial Virginia homes&mdash;a central hallway with one or two rooms on each side, with
chimneys at each end serving fireplaces in each room. In the case of Green Spring Farm,
a narrow (4-foot 6-inch-wide) central hallway runs straight through from the front door to
an opposing rear door. Floor boards are of random width (5 to 6 inches), and walls are
paneled 3 feet 6 inches up from the floor, with wallpaper above. Doorways open off the
central hallway into a library (east side) and a dining room (west side).</p>
<p>Prior to 1942, the rear portion of the center hallway contained stairways to the second
floor and to the basement, while still allowing access to the rear door. In 1942, however,
the stairway to the basement was shifted to the west (new kitchen) wing, which was built
at that time; and the stairway to the second floor was shifted into the library.<a name='FNanchor_0091' id='FNanchor_0091'></a><a href='#Footnote_0091' class='fnanchor'>[91]</a></p>
<p>In the library, at the rear of the room a narrow (2-foot 6-inch-wide) stairway rises from
the corner nearest the hallway to the second floor hallway above (figure 13). This stairway
extends over the hall doorway and, together with a panel-and-spindle partition, forms
a covered entryway into the room. A small closet utilizes the space underneath the stairs.</p>
<p>The present library is a designed room, created in 1942 by Walter Macomber. The design
utilizes the full width of the house and thus replaces two rooms (approximately 12 by 12
feet) which originally had comprised the first area east of the central hallway. This original
room design had had a fireplace in each of these two rooms, and in 1942 both were
replaced. The one serving the rear room was taken out entirely as the doorway into the
living room wing was cut through at that point. The one in the former front room was
replaced by another fireplace, specially designed by Mr. Macomber, and built of materials
from a late eighteenth century tavern near Peace Cross, Maryland.<a name='FNanchor_0092' id='FNanchor_0092'></a><a href='#Footnote_0092' class='fnanchor'>[92]</a></p>
<p>Built into the east wall of the library on each side of the fireplace are identical cabinets,
the lower parts of which are enclosed and the upper parts are open shelves. The overmantel
area is wallpapered, as are the portions of the room&#8217;s wall occupied by the window
facing the front yard and the wall between the library and central hallway. Open shelving
for books occupies part of this latter wall, to a height of eight feet.</p>
<p>The entire room has a cornice molding of stained wood, matching the paneling used for
the stairs, the fireplace, and the built-in cabinets flanking the fireplace.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
Across the central hallway, the present dining room was designed and created in 1942.
As in the case of the library, brick interior walls separating two smaller rooms (approximately
12 by 12 feet) were removed to allow the dining room to utilize the full width (25
feet) of the house. The fireplace serving the rear of the original rooms was replaced by a
doorway into the new kitchen wing through a butler&#8217;s pantry. The fireplace serving the
front of the original rooms was retained in the present dining room. Beside this fireplace
and extending to the front wall is a butterfly cupboard specially designed for that location.
Chair rail, baseboard, and door trim in the room are thought to be original; but the ceiling
cornice was added in 1942 and consists of double-ogee design over beaded plasterboard
which is typical of the period of the house.<a name='FNanchor_0093' id='FNanchor_0093'></a><a href='#Footnote_0093' class='fnanchor'>[93]</a> A cupboard by the doorway to the butler&#8217;s
pantry is of modern design and was installed as an added convenience in the dining room.</p>
<p>The doors to the central hallway and to the butler&#8217;s pantry are thought to have been
originally on the second floor of the house.<a name='FNanchor_0094' id='FNanchor_0094'></a><a href='#Footnote_0094' class='fnanchor'>[94]</a> The hallway door has six panels, with
beaded edges and quarter-round molding in the panels. A fillet molding
(4½
inches)
surrounds the doorway frame. The door has been drastically trimmed to fit the frame.
The door to the butler&#8217;s pantry has four panels but with a flat raised panel and no
quarter-round molding at the panel edges&mdash;a style typical of the later nineteenth century.</p>
<p>The second floor of the central block of the house originally was laid out identically with
the first floor&mdash;that is, two rooms on each side of a central hallway. In the 1942 renovation,
this same room arrangement was retained for the west side of the central hall (above
the dining room), while on the east side of the hall a single bedroom (12 by 25 feet) was
created using the full depth of the house. In this bedroom, cabinets with louvered double
doors were installed on each side of the fireplace and painted white to match the fireplace
mantel. This fireplace is one of the features retained from the original house and has a
mantel which is plain except for a denticulated molding. Chair rail, also thought to be
original, is installed on all exposed areas of wall in the room.</p>
<p>Across the central hallway, the two bedrooms retain the same basic design of the original
house. Both are approximately 11 by 11 feet and have random-width flooring and chair
rail on two sides of the room. The original fireplaces have been retained in these rooms.
In the front room, the fireplace mantel is entirely plain; in the rear room, the mantel has
two supporting columns and has three diamond shapes carved in the wood. Both rooms
have built-in cabinets, shelves, and closets, some of which were installed in 1942 and some
which were added in 1960. Also added in 1942 is the door connecting the front bedroom
with the staircase from the first floor of the west wing. Through the passageway at the
head of these stairs, there is access to the second floor of the west wing.</p>
<p>The third floor (or attic) is entered by a stairway in the central staircase. At the head of
this stairway is a hallway connecting bedrooms in the east and west ends of the house and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
providing access to closets at the rear of the house and a small bathroom (7 by 7 feet) at
the front of the house. The bathroom has a dormer window to the front of the house,
and each of the bedrooms has a dormer window to the front and a window in the gable
end wall. The gable end windows are set in plaster arches, flanked in each case by a 4-foot-high
candle shelf. Both bedrooms have built-in closets, cupboards, and shelves. Bedroom
walls have plain plaster finish and plain wooden baseboards, no cornices, and no chair rail.</p>
<p><i>East Wing.</i> The east wing of the house presently includes the living room and a sunporch.
The floor level of this wing is 1 foot 8 inches lower than the floor level of the central
block; and the connecting doorway has three steps, with double doors at the top step.</p>
<p>The date when the east wing was built is not certain, but it is probable that the basic structure
comprising the wing was constructed around 1840 and thereafter used as a kitchen or
combination kitchen-dining room until the renovation of the house in 1942. Photographs
taken about 1900 and in 1936 show this wing with a door opening to the front of the
house at ground level. The floor of the old kitchen was laid with cobblestones, and the
east end of the room had a great hearth and Dutch oven. Food was cooked here and
taken up the stairs into the main part of the house. Many other household chores (such
as soapmaking) were performed here.<a name='FNanchor_0095' id='FNanchor_0095'></a><a href='#Footnote_0095' class='fnanchor'>[95]</a></p>
<p>When the house was renovated in 1942, the cobblestone floor of the room was overlaid
with wooden flooring and pine wainscotting was added to the walls. On the north side,
looking out onto the semicircular lawn, a picture window was installed. On the south
side of the room, the outside door was replaced with a window similar to the one already
in that side (figure 9). The large hearth and fireplace were replaced with a smaller one
similar to what had been installed in the library (with the unusual wooden lintel).</p>
<p>According to the renovator, the paneling for the doorway connecting the living room and
library came from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The overmantel and paneling around the
living room fireplace and over the doorway connecting the living room and sunporch came
from a tavern near Peace Cross, Maryland, where it had been used as shuttering.<a name='FNanchor_0096' id='FNanchor_0096'></a><a href='#Footnote_0096' class='fnanchor'>[96]</a> The
architraves around the fireplace and pilasters were designed by the renovator from materials
obtained in Pennsylvania.<a name='FNanchor_0097' id='FNanchor_0097'></a><a href='#Footnote_0097' class='fnanchor'>[97]</a> The cornice in the living room is of cypress wood.</p>
<p>Entrance to the sunporch from the living room is through a doorway trimmed in material
from an old building in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Wrought iron H hinges are used on the built-in cabinets in the east wall (next to the fireplace).
The sunporch door has wrought iron hinges and a brass box lock.</p>
<p>The sunporch, added to the east wing in 1942, is frame construction on a concrete slab
floor. When built, it was a screened porch, but later was converted to glass window panels
to accommodate plants and pet animals in all seasons.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></div>
<p>On the second floor of the east wing is a bedroom and bathroom suite, entered from the
central block of the house on the second floor level. Dormer windows are on the north
(rear) and south (front) sides of the bedroom, and the bathroom has a dormer window on
the north side. The bedroom has built-in closets, shelves, and cupboards, the hardware of
which is wrought iron. Doors have box locks and small brass door knobs. Two steps are
built into the doorway connecting the east wing with the central block of the house on
the second floor level.</p>
<p><i>West Wing.</i> The west wing of the house was added in 1942, and was designed by the
renovator, Walter Macomber.</p>
<p>The first floor contains a modern kitchen, a butler&#8217;s pantry, and a staircase containing
stairways to the basement and to the second floor, together with storage closets. An
exterior door in the end wall provides direct access to the outside.</p>
<p>The second floor of the west wing contains a bedroom and bathroom suite similar in layout
to the suite on the second floor of the east wing. The bedroom contains built-in
closets, shelves, and cupboards, and wrought iron hardware (thumb latches and H and L
hinges).</p>
<p><i>Basement.</i> The basement is beneath the central block of the house, and its design is basically
unchanged from the original except for the concrete footings and steel columns
placed there in 1960 to strengthen the deteriorating brick interior wall. The basement
was not extended underneath either of the two wings of the house when they were
constructed.</p>
<p>Entrance to the basement originally was by a stairway located at the end of the central
hallway, where also was located the stairway to the second floor and attic. In 1942, however,
the stairway to the basement was shifted to a new staircase located in the new west
wing of the house, where it is at the present time. The basement currently contains gas
heating equipment for the house, a water heater, and storage space.</p>

<p>David Condon, AIA; interview December 11, 1969. The earlier room layout of the central
block of the house had two rooms, each about 12 by 12 feet, on each side of the central hallway which
ran through the house widthwise. Each of these four rooms had its own fireplace located in the end
wall. This pattern was duplicated in the four rooms on the second floor.</p>
<p>A somewhat unusual feature of this building was that the joists for the first and second
floors ran lengthwise rather than across the house. They were anchored in the brick outer wall and in a
brick bearing wall running the width of the house in the basement and extending up to the second floor.
In 1960, it was found that this wall was crumbling and in danger of allowing the second-floor joists to
pull out of their sockets. The installation of a series of steel columns holding up a steel beam had the
effect of taking all bearing weight off this original segment of brick wall.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote'><a name='Footnote_0089' id='Footnote_0089'></a><a href='#FNanchor_0089'><span class='label'>[89]</span></a>
<p><i>Ibid.</i> The location of this masonry wall in the basement and its extension upward to the
second floor made it possible for the original house to have the floor joists set lengthwise with the house
instead of front-to-back. The joists were thus anchored in the outside walls at each end of the house and
in the center wall running midway through the house.</p>

<p>Walter Macomber, interview held July 16, 1968, at Green Spring Farm. Mr. Macomber&#8217;s
description of these shingles is as follows: &#8220;This shingle is something I helped develop for Williamsburg.
We never did use it extensively, but it was made ... in Richmond [by] a man named Hendricks.... It&#8217;s
made of concrete reinforced with two or three wires to the length of it.&#8221;</p>

<div class='footnote'><a name='Footnote_0091' id='Footnote_0091'></a><a href='#FNanchor_0091'><span class='label'>[91]</span></a>
<p><i>Ibid.</i> This stairway was also reversed when it was moved into the library. As it originally
stood in the hallway, the stairway ran upward from front to rear of the house, and a stairway to the
basement was constructed underneath so as to run down to the basement from the rear to the front of
the house.</p>
<p>A second stairway between the first and second floors was also installed in a new staircase
constructed in the new kitchen (west) wing built in 1942.</p>

<p><i>Ibid.</i> Transcript of Mr. Macomber&#8217;s description of the library is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Mr. Macomber</i>: Now this room&mdash;the library&mdash;is a designed room.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Netherton</i>: By you, do you mean?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Macomber</i>: Yes.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Netherton</i>: Do you know what the room was before?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Macomber</i>: Well, it was really plain.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Netherton</i>: Is this an Adam mantelpiece?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Macomber</i>: You could call this an Adam mantel, although it&#8217;s not truly. It&#8217;s a mantel
of about 1790.... This wood came from an old tavern near Peace Cross in Maryland. The
building was torn down to make way for a large shopping center. This is all designed. This
is a design of my own with the little dovetails which are a little affectation of mine.
[Pointing to the entryway between the library and central hall.] At least part of this stair
was original. The newel post and the balusters and the paneling under the first run of the
stair are original, and the sheathing from that point up into the hall is a design, and was
made right on the job by our carpenters.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Netherton</i>: Did you lengthen these windows to the floor?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Macomber</i>: They were this way when we got the house, but they had been changed
some time prior to 1942.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p><i>Mrs. Netherton</i>: The cupboard was part of the design, was it not?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Macomber</i>: Yes, it was, and I think this is one of the panels that came from Pennsylvania....
[Also] the paneled jamb from the library down into the living room came from
this old building in Lancaster County [Pennsylvania]. And also the trim around the
opening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The renovator&#8217;s description of the dining room included the following comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Mr. Macomber</i>: The mantel is a mantel of the period, and I&#8217;m quite sure it was in this room.
The butterfly cupboard beside it is a design that was added to the room, and designed and
built and installed for this particular location. The dining room, being a small room, we
planned the recess beside the fireplace for the sideboard and also to give a little more space
in the room and in the pantry. The chair rail I&#8217;m sure is original and the door trim, but the
cornice I installed. The base is original, in most cases, I believe the doors are original,
although the bottom rail has been cut off on this to such a degree, it looks as though it
might have been for another opening. And that&#8217;s true on the door into the library.</p>

<p><i>Ibid.</i> Mr. Macomber&#8217;s recollection is that &#8220;I&#8217;m quite sure it came from the second floor
because it&#8217;s the same as the door into the nursery room....&#8221; As to the door into the hallway, he notes
that it originally had been painted dark blue-green.</p>

<p><i>Ibid.</i> According to local tradition, the tavern near Peace Cross originally was a residence,
then a tavern, a gambling house, and a bawdy house. While a gambling house, it was robbed, and shots
were fired after the fleeing burglar. One of the shots went into the shutters, and the hole made by this
shot is still visible in the portion of the shutter used as paneling in the living room.</p>

<h3>I. THE TOBEY HOUSE</h3>
</div>
<h4>HISTORY</h4>
<p>The Tobey House is located approximately one-quarter mile east-southeast of
the main house on Green Spring Farm. It was built in 1954 as a residence for Mrs. Charles
W. Tobey, the mother of Mrs. Michael Straight and widow of the late distinguished
United States Senator from New Hampshire. Prior to that time, Mrs. Tobey had resided
part of the time in Washington and part of the time in Concord, New Hampshire, where
she owned a spacious, gabled New England mansion built about 1750. In order for her to
be nearer her daughter and grandchildren, arrangements were made by Michael Straight to
have a small, modern, open-design house built for Mrs. Tobey on Green Spring Farm.<a name='FNanchor_0098' id='FNanchor_0098'></a><a href='#Footnote_0098' class='fnanchor'>[98]</a></p>
<p>Architectural plans were completed in the fall of 1953, and construction was completed
in 1954. Here Mrs. Tobey lived with her housekeeper, Miss Frances McFall, from 1954 to
1968.<a name='FNanchor_0099' id='FNanchor_0099'></a><a href='#Footnote_0099' class='fnanchor'>[99]</a></p>
<p>The house originally was comprised of a living-dining room, kitchen, two bedrooms, bath,
and utility (heater) room. In 1957, however, it was expanded by the addition of another
living room, bathroom, and utility room. At this time, also, the carport was relocated,
and terraces were created on the east and west sides of the house. The result was to
enlarge the living space within the house and to create an arrangement whereby a living
room, bath, and utility room could be partitioned off (by a folding door) to make a guest
suite. The addition of the semienclosed areas adjacent to the house, with their flagstone
terraces and fountain pool, made for the enjoyment of outdoor activities.</p>
<p>Inside the house, the design and decor encouraged the feeling of closeness to the outdoors
by the location of window space and the use of floor-to-ceiling glass walls at points where
the landscaped surroundings of the house could be seen from the inside; and paneled walls
provided a neutral yet sympathetic background for many fine pieces of antique furniture
and other artifacts which Mrs. Tobey brought from New Hampshire. Also, use of horizontal
ship-lap siding for the exterior gives a suggestion of New England clapboards.</p>
<p>Following her residence in the house from 1954 to 1968, Mrs. Tobey moved to
Washington, D.C., and the house was occupied by tenants.</p>

<h4>GENERAL SETTING AND SITE OF THE HOUSE</h4>
<p>Located in the southeast corner of
Green Spring Farm, the Tobey House enjoys a setting of generally open, slightly rolling
countryside.<a name='FNanchor_0100' id='FNanchor_0100'></a><a href='#Footnote_0100' class='fnanchor'>[100]</a> This setting is preserved on the land which comprises the farm. Beyond
these limits, however, the neighborhood of the farm has experienced a rapid and drastic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
transition in the 1950&#8217;s and 1960&#8217;s. As a result, its predominantly rural character has been
largely replaced by tracts of subdivisions composed of single-family dwellings on lots
ranging from one-fifth to one-half acre of land. At the same time, the Little River Turnpike
(Route 236) has attracted extensive roadside commercial development, resulting in
increased highway traffic generated by the intensified density of land use. This has
accentuated the importance of the farm&#8217;s buffer space in preserving the tranquility and
natural beauty which the owner and architect sought for the Tobey House.</p>
<p>The site of the house is set back from the Little River Turnpike approximately one-eighth
mile and is connected with the pike by its own driveway. The driveway approaches the
house from the southwest where the view first is of the carport and the 1957 addition.
The immediate vicinity of the house has been left relatively open to provide a feeling of
spaciousness when viewed from inside the house. Landscaped trees and shrubs located
around the house preserve this feeling of an open natural setting while providing cover for
the house and terraces.</p>
<h4>ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN</h4>
<p>Since it was Mrs. Tobey&#8217;s desire to enjoy the site as well as
the house, the general design of the house contains features specifically aimed to permit
this. On the east side, the flagstone terrace and fountain pool are partially covered by the
overhang of the flat roof and a trellis. On the west side of the house, a covered flagstone
walkway from house to the carport runs between a hedge and fence on one side and a
small courtyard with flower beds and trees on the other. In the living room added in
1957, the only opening is a large picture window set in a bay which contains a planter box
with living plants.</p>
<p>Architecturally, the house is of particular interest because its basic objective of facilitating
an indoor-outdoor style of living is achieved with simple, open lines and harmonious
materials.<a name='FNanchor_0101' id='FNanchor_0101'></a><a href='#Footnote_0101' class='fnanchor'>[101]</a> Set upon a concrete slab, the wooden walls of the house are overlaid with
wooden beams placed so as to intersect and create the appearance of squares and rectangular
modules on the ceiling. A flat wooden deck roof rests on these beams. No prefabricated
units were utilized in the construction of the house, and all pieces were
individually specified, cut, and fitted together.</p>
<p>The architect for the Tobey House was David Condon, AIA, of Keyes, Lethbridge &amp;
Condon, Washington, D.C. The landscape architect was Eric Paepcke of Washington,
D.C. Interior design was done by Top Recker and Patricia Holsaert. Construction was
performed by Hayes Brothers of Herndon, Virginia (figures 14 and 15).</p>
<h4>EXTERIOR FEATURES</h4>
<p>The overall dimensions of the house are 70 by 25 feet; the
carport measures 11 by 21 feet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
Exterior walls are gray stained cypress, laid on horizontally in ship-lap style, with white
trim. Full-length glass panels serve as walls in the section of the house called &#8220;the gallery,&#8221;
facing the terrace on the east side of the house.</p>
<p>The fountain pool in the east side terrace measures 6 by 13 feet. The pool water does not
recirculate but is piped from the house water supply and can be controlled by a faucet.</p>
<h4>ENCLOSURES</h4>
<p>A wooden post and rail ranch fence encloses the field where the house
is located.</p>
<h4>LANDSCAPING</h4>
<p>Pine and plane trees are planted for shade near the house and screening
from the highway on the west side. Wisteria is planted for the trellis over the terrace on
the west side of the house to shield it from the afternoon sun. In the immediate vicinity
of the house, vinca minor (periwinkle) is used as ground cover.</p>
<h4>INTERIOR FEATURES</h4>
<p>The Tobey House contains 2,062 square feet of floor space.</p>
<p>Room arrangements for the original structure and following the addition in 1957 are
shown in figure 15.</p>
<p>Interior walls are of vertical cypress paneling, and floors are wooden parquet. Ceilings
have exposed beam and plank construction.</p>
<p>Interior features when Mrs. Tobey was in residence included wood carvings from a
Scandinavian sailing ship salvaged when it sank off the New England Coast.</p>
<p>Woodburning fireplaces are located in the living room of the original portion of the house
(now used as a study) and the living room of the 1957 addition.</p>
<p>The house is centrally heated with radiant heat from the floor. No central air conditioning
was provided in the original portion; but, when the addition was built in 1957, central air
conditioning was provided for it and ducts were extended into the living room of the
original portion. Window air-conditioning units were installed in the bedrooms.</p>

<a name='II_THE_BARN' id='II_THE_BARN'></a>
<h3>II. THE BARN</h3>
</div>
<p>Located approximately 200 feet northeast of the main house is a two-story frame barn.
Its date of construction is not certain, but it is known to have been present when the
Straights acquired the farm in 1942. During the occupancy of the farm by the Straights,
the barn was converted into a laundry and a maid&#8217;s apartment. As renovated for this
purpose, the first floor of the barn contained space and equipment for the laundry, a
kitchen, and a bathroom. The second floor contained living quarters and a bathroom.
Access to the second floor was by an exterior stairway (figure 17).</p>
<p>Overall dimensions of the barn are
14½
by
24½
feet. Its construction is frame with eight-inch
siding laid on vertically and two-inch battens used to cover and seal the joints. The
exterior is stained brown with no trim. The exterior stairway is constructed of wood and
leads to a second floor entrance in the center of the east end of the building. The stairway
is in two segments. One, on the south side, reaches from the ground to a landing at the
corner of the building; the other, on the east side, reaches from the landing to the entrance
door. The peak of the roof is approximately
17½
feet from the ground.</p>

<h3>III. THE LOG CABIN</h3>
</div>
<p>Located approximately 90 feet northeast of the main house is a small one-story house of
log construction. Its date of construction is uncertain, although it is possible that this
building is the &#8220;Servants&#8217; House&#8221; referred to in the notice of the commissioner&#8217;s sale of
the farm following the death of William Moss in 1835.<a name='FNanchor_0102' id='FNanchor_0102'></a><a href='#Footnote_0102' class='fnanchor'>[102]</a></p>
<p>During the Straights&#8217; occupancy of the farm, the cabin was renovated and converted into
a guest house. During the later years, their son, David, lived in the cabin.</p>
<p>The renovation carried out by the Straights resulted in enlargement and reframing of the
windows, reconstruction of the existing door on the west side, and reconstruction of the
brick chimney at the north end of the building. At the same time, another doorway was
added on the east side (figure 18).</p>

<h3>IV. THE SPRING HOUSE</h3>
</div>
<h4>HISTORY</h4>
<p>References to a spring house appear frequently in descriptions of Green
Spring Farm during the nineteenth century.<a name='FNanchor_0103' id='FNanchor_0103'></a><a href='#Footnote_0103' class='fnanchor'>[103]</a> The well watered character of the farm,
possessing springs of its own and traversed by Turkey Cock Run, was an advantage of
great value to all its owners. Quite possibly the presence of the springs was decisive in
enabling both the Mosses and Fountain Beattie to make dairying a substantial part of the
farm&#8217;s operations. In the 1830&#8217;s, many of the types of equipment and utensils typically
used in making and preserving butter, cheese, and fresh milk were listed in inventories of
personal property at the farm. During this period and later, the presence of the Little
River Turnpike would have made it feasible to sell dairy products regularly in Alexandria,
six miles away, and in the District of Columbia, nine miles away.<a name='FNanchor_0104' id='FNanchor_0104'></a><a href='#Footnote_0104' class='fnanchor'>[104]</a> It is equally likely that
a spring house was also one of the focal points of the farm&#8217;s cider and brandy-making
activities at those times when the orchards flourished.</p>
<p>After the sale of the farm by Fountain Beattie in 1917, the level of its operations gradually
decreased. By 1940, the spring house stood unused, as neither dairying nor orchard activities
were carried on. Therefore, when the Straights ordered the renovation of the main
house in 1942, it was suggested that the spring house be converted into a residence for the
farm&#8217;s caretaker.</p>
<p>Conversion of the spring house into a residence was carried out under the direction of
Walter Macomber of Washington, D.C., who also had been in charge of remodeling the
main house. Using the basic stone shell of the house, which was structurally sound, a two-story
house was designed with living room, bedroom, kitchen, and utility (heater) room
on the first floor and a bedroom, bathroom, and storage area on the second floor.<a name='FNanchor_0105' id='FNanchor_0105'></a><a href='#Footnote_0105' class='fnanchor'>[105]</a> (See
figure 19.) In this work, new materials were used, except that slate shingles taken from
the main house (where the roof was being replaced) were used for roofing the spring
house.</p>
<p>In 1961, the second major remodeling of the house enlarged it and attempted to reduce
the dampness due to its location in the midst of the springs. The architects for this work
were Keyes, Lethbridge &amp; Condon of Washington, D.C. As a result of this work, the
roof was raised to permit construction of a new bedroom and storage room on the second
floor. On the first floor, enclosure of a porch permitted the addition of a bathroom and
closet to the downstairs bedroom. Substantial remodeling of the kitchen was also undertaken,
in which a closet was converted into cabinets, new flooring was laid, and new
kitchen fixtures were installed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></div>
<h4>EXTERIOR</h4>
<p>The original portion of the spring house is constructed of stone, with stucco
exterior finish. The frame addition is covered with rough-sawn redwood lap siding over
half-inch vapor-sealed sheathing. The roofing for this portion of the house is slate shingles,
matching the slate roof of the original portion which used shingles taken from the mansion
house when it was renovated in 1942. Copper gutters and downspouts were installed in
1961, as was copper flashing at the base of the chimney.</p>

<p>David Condon, AIA, interview December 12, 1969. Initially it was proposed to locate the
house with its back to a line of trees separating the upper and lower portions of the pasture west of the
main farm house. This would have taken advantage of the view to the west of the house, considered to
be its best view. Ultimately, however, the house was located in the lower pasture, closer to the Little
River Turnpike but screened from the highway by a line of trees planted for that purpose.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX E</h2>
</div>
<p>Transcript of part of an affidavit from Thomas R. Love and Alfred Moss to Judge John Scott of the
Circuit Superior Court.</p>
<p>To the
Hon<sup>b</sup>le
John Scott Judge of the Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery of the County of
Fairfax. Respectfully Complaining Herewith unto your Honor, your Orators Thomas R. Love guardian
of Charles R. and Armistead T. Moss, and Alfred Moss guardian of Edgar and John Thomas Moss, the
three first infant Children of Thomas Moss
dec<sup>d</sup> &amp; the last named the infant son of Jno Moss dec<sup>d</sup>
son of
Thomas Moss&mdash;</p>
<p>That Thomas Moss died intestate on the ____ day of October, 1839, leaving Seven Children and One grand
Child in all his Heirs at Law&mdash;viz. Anna R. Love the wife of your Orator Thomas R. Love, Robert Moss,
Alfred Moss, Thomas Moss &amp; the four infant Children just named&mdash;Edgar the Eldest of these infant
Children will be 20 years old in November of the present year. Charles R. will be 18 years old in the
month of March 1840, Armistead 16 in the month of December in the present year and John Thomas
Moss will ____ years old in the month of ____ 18__.</p>
<p>The real Estate of which Thomas Moss died seized in ____ was the tract of land on which he resided at the
time of his death situated on both sides of the Little River Turnpike Road about Six miles from Alexandria
containing about 320 Acres. This tract of land is the only real Estate to which the Heirs at Law
of said Thomas Moss are entitled in the said County of Fairfax or Elsewhere&mdash;This tract of land is naturally
a thin soil but from a careful course of husbandry for a number of years, is now in a good state of
cultivation, the fields well enclosed by good and substantial fencing, the land not in cultivation well taken
with grass (clover and timothy) and that in cultivation just sown down in winter grass, and the buildings
in a good state of repair, the barn and stables having been Erected in the last two or three years&mdash;</p>
<p>Your orators have been advised by persons in the neighbourhood with whom they have conversed, with
the view of getting the best advice and information on the subject that the tract of land would not now
rent for more than ____ per annum, which would give to each of the Heirs in the shape of rent
Twenty five or Thirty dollars annually&mdash;while on the other hand owing as your Orators believe to the
Convenient distance thence to Alexandria, George Town and Washington and the improved state of the
farm in other respects, it would sell upon the usual terms of Sales of land for Twenty five dollars per
Acre and thus afford an interest on the sale nearly double the annual rent&mdash;In addition to the fact that
the rent would greatly fall short of the interest on the sale your orators have been advised that the property
in the hands of tenants would in the course of a few years be excessively injured and lessened in
value, the soil impoverished, the buildings and fencing neglected and suffered to delapidate perhaps
destroyed.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the land cannot be advantageously divided among the heirs Eight in number it would
give about forty acres to each heir, and this without regard to improvements&mdash;And the consideration
deeply affecting the interests of the infant is that this farm must be rented out all the shares together
manifestly&mdash;if therefore those now of age and those that soon will be of age should sell their shares each
share thus sold off, will not only proportionally lessen in value the shares of the other remaining unsold,
but will place the younger children as they come of age in the power and at the mercy of the person who
shall have purchased the other shares of the co-terminus neighbour. In the End the consequence will be
that the two or three younger children will not only be forced to sell, being hemmed in on all sides, and
not able to add to their Inheritance but must sell at any price they are offered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
Your orators further state that besides the real Estate before mentioned in which their wards have as
interest One Eighth each, after the payment of the debts of Thomas Moss deceased so far as it is practicable
to make an Estimate at this time, it is believed that a surplus will be left for distribution of about
fifteen or sixteen thousand dollars, which will give to each child say two thousand&mdash;</p>
<p>Viewing the present interest as well as the future interests of their wards your orators are of the opinion
from the facts hereinbefore stated, that the interests of their wards manifestly require a sale of the real
Estate herein before mentioned and that the rights of others will not be thereby violated. And to that
end and in pursuance of the Acts of the Gen&#8217;l Assembly in such cases made and provided, they pray that
said Anna R. Love late Anna R. Moss, Alfred Moss, Robert, Thomas Edgar, Charles R., Armistead and
John Thomas Moss be made parties defendants to this bill&mdash;that the said Anna R. Love the wife of your
orator and Alfred Moss who would be two of the Heirs of either of said infants if they are dead and that
said Anna R. be permitted to answer for herself as if feme sole. That the said Anna R. Love, Robert
Moss, Alfred Moss, Thomas Moss and all the other infants herein before mentioned who are over fourteen
years of age may be compelled to answer this bill in proper person or oath&mdash;That a Guardian Ad Litem
may be appointed according to Law to defend and answer for those infants as well those over fourteen

<h2>APPENDIX G</h2>
<h3>A Visit from Mr. Polevoy</h3>
</div>
<p class='center'><b>THE NEW REPUBLIC</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soviet newspapers are bitter about the insincerity of American visitors to their
country. While in the USSR, they say, Americans are lavish with their praise, but on
returning home, they speak quite differently of Russia to their fellow Americans.
Our newspapers in turn maintain that Soviet delegations to this country wear a mask
of friendliness but once back in Russia present a hostile and unrecognizable picture
of the United States.</p>
<p>Do visiting Soviet delegations present a true picture of their travels here to their
own people? The editors of <i>The NR</i> have been given an opportunity to test this
question. A delegation of leading Soviet writers visited the United States in October,
1955, under the chairmanship of Boris Kampov-Polevoy, a Soviet novelist and Secretary
of the Union of Soviet Writers. Mr. Polevoy and four members of his delegation
spent one evening at the house of the <i>NR</i> editor-at-large. In the third of his articles
on his journeys through the US published in the March issue of the Soviet monthly,
<i>Oktyabr</i>, Mr. Polevoy describes the occasion as he remembers it. A translation of his
article, and our comments follow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the evening we were invited to be the guests of Mr.
Michael Straight, editor of the magazine <i>The New
Republic</i>, at his out-of-town villa bearing the poetic
name of &#8220;Green Spring Farm.&#8221; This tiny villa was in
no way different from the small suburban houses of
well-to-do members of the &#8220;intelligentsia&#8221; which we already
had the opportunity of visiting. Alone the huge
agglomeration of books on long shelves&mdash;quite unusual
for an American home&mdash;and the beautiful pictures on
the walls revealed that the owners of this house had a
passion for literature and an artistic taste which could
enable them to discriminate between works of genuine
art and the militant flatness, which under the mask of
innovationism has impertinently seized the key positions
in American art. There were canvasses and drawings
which not only prompted one to wonder on passing
by, but which induced a desire to stop, to admire
and to think.</p>
<p>The people who had gathered at the house were interesting
too&mdash;journalists who had traveled a great deal,
who had witnessed many events, who were able to
think. A unionist leader was also present&mdash;an observing,
aggressive, skeptical man.</p>
<p>At the outset&mdash;as it is the custom in the United States&mdash;the
host showed us around his house. The five of us
were jammed in for quite a while on the second floor
in the tiny bedrooms of his two sons. David, the eldest,
a fair-haired, healthy looking youngster, had his little
room in a state of complete disorder. The radio was
roaring, the gay green parakeets were screaming. Some
radio parts together with books, screwdrivers, tubes of
glue, bookbinders and knives were heaped on the table.
The little occupant, apparently ready to go to bed, was
sitting on his bed without his shirt and was reading
something. At the sight of strangers he felt bashful,
grabbed his shirt, started putting it on and when his
head eventually emerged through its collar, his face
and his ears were flushed and his brow pearled with
sweat. However, having dressed, he immediately regained
his composure and, as though nothing had happened,
stretched out his hand with earnest poise. David&mdash;he
introduced himself.</p>
<p>His younger brother, Mikey, had an artistic temperament.
His table was all smeared with water-colors and
pictures were hanging on the walls&mdash;fantastic tanks,
ships, sinister profiles of Indians, noble-featured cowboys
wearing hats of incredible dimensions. Mikey was
evidently successful in this hobby of his and, after looking
at his drawings, one could tell him without false
flattery that he was an artist of the realist school and
that many of his pictures were more accurate and perfect
as to form than whatever is being exhibited by quite
adult &#8220;uncles&#8221; at the opening of exhibitions of the so-called
&#8220;new art.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mikey dressed, too, and we came down in a group to
the living room where Gribatchov was having an argument
with our American colleagues. The topic was familiar,
I should even say a classical one&mdash;the freedom
of the press. In the heat of the dispute the <i>NR</i> publisher
proposed to Gribatchov an exchange of articles on
important international topics under reciprocal terms&mdash;once
a week the editor of <i>The New Republic</i> would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
publish an article in the <i>Literary Gazette</i> presenting the
American viewpoint on some specific problem and once
a week a representative of the <i>Literary Gazette</i> would
give the Soviet point of view in an article in <i>The New
Republic</i>. Apparently this idea seemed very attractive to
our American colleague, and he was attacking Gribatchov
with quite a lot of energy.</p>
<p>I did not have a chance to hear the argument to its
end. The fair-haired David, with whom I had become
quite friendly, dragged me away to the next room. We
conversed in the manner of cavemen, using dramatic
gesticulations and incoherent sounds, and yet we somehow
managed to understand each other. David even
managed to convey that he had built that radio himself,
and that he likes to listen to Russian music. In proof
of this he even sang, with boyish diligence and with a
broken juvenile &#8220;basso,&#8221; a melody taken out of <i>Swan
Lake</i>. However, he rendered it with a foxtrot rhythm.</p>
<p>I really liked that lively American youngster with
his tall build, his curly fair hair, his rooster-like voice
and his absent-minded disposition which strongly reminded
me of my eldest son.</p>
<p>David showed me his favorite books, and then he
suddenly produced a peculiar-looking magazine printed
with a multigraph. He prodded his chest in a self-satisfied
manner to demonstrate to me that this was his own
magazine. He showed me a caricature drawing with
his finger and then pointed his finger at Mikey, thus
making clear that his brother was the artist.</p>
<p>Then the children ran back to the living room and
came back dragging their father with them and M. M.
Lopuchin, whom they had literally abducted out of an
interesting conversation with the ladies. It was then that
I came to hear the story of the magazine, which bore the
romantic name <i>The Green Spring-Menemsha Gazette</i>.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Michael senior, the children&#8217;s father, evidently
liked their undertaking. He sat down on the carpet
next to us and as he was turning the pages
of the magazine, he told us that out of a wish to imitate
their father, the children had decided to start a publication.
They wrote articles and other items, prepared illustrations
and caricatures and arranged the whole material
inside a copybook. They kept quiet so long that their
parents wondered what their rowdy boys were doing.
The parents went upstairs and found the boys busy over
a heap of papers; the <i>Gazette</i> was already being &#8220;paged
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>David, the editor of the publication, knew from his
father&#8217;s experience that every printed organ must have
readers. The children begged their father to give them
a typewriter and when they got it, began to type patiently,
with one finger, one page after the other, learning
the art of typing in the process of their work.</p>
<p>Seeing that the children&#8217;s interest did not abate, the
father gave them a present&mdash;a cheap toy &#8220;Shapirograph&#8221;&mdash;to
print their magazine. Having secured production
equipment, the editorial staff began to work
with renewed energy. David, who up to that time was
sharing his interest among many pursuits, forsook his
former preferences. Even the little green parakeets,
whom he loved dearly, were left without food quite
often and sadly chattered in their cage. David had the
jobs of editor, author of articles and typographer. The
sturdy Mikey was the publisher, artist and supplier of
funny stories. A neighbor&#8217;s little girl, Xandra Babel,
was responsible for the news and special events&mdash;indispensable
departments of every American editorial unit
worthy of this name.</p>
<p>At any rate, no matter how, the magazine eventually
appeared. It was even printed in 75 copies, diligently
bound and, the following year when the family left for
the beach during the hot season, to the mother&#8217;s great
dismay, the whole issue and even the typographic equipment
consisting of the typewriter and the multigraph as
well as the paper stocks were taken along.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>During the summer the children made friends with
a certain Mr. Zur, an original
character and owner
of the Menemsha store.
The old man liked children
and whenever they
came to his shop to buy
candy, salted nuts or a bag
of popcorn, they always
used to stay there for a
while and discuss the
weather, politics and all
sorts of events with him.
Mr. Zur used to talk to
children as though they were grownups, and this contributed
a lot to his popularity. When they arrived at
the summer resort, the first thing the children did was
to run to their old friend&#8217;s shop and there, as they were
eating fresh cracking popcorn, they told him the staggering
news&mdash;they had published a magazine.</p>
<p>&#8220;A magazine? And how much costs one copy of
your magazine, gentlemen?&#8221; inquired Mr. Zur in a businesslike
manner.</p>
<p>The children exchanged quick glances. Somehow they
had not arrived at the thought that their magazine could
be sold.</p>
<p>&#8220;It costs nothing, sir,&#8221; David started saying.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, it costs one dollar,&#8221; the quick-witted Mikey
interrupted his brother as this new aspect of their hobby
began to dawn upon him. &#8220;One dollar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather expensive, gentlemen. However, I enjoy
reading, and so I will buy one copy,&#8221; replied the old
shopkeeper and handed over a dirty green bill to the
journalists. They were left quite speechless by this development.</p>
<p>The business was continued. Realizing that there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
were quite a few funny people among the dwellers in
that summer resort and wishing to please his little
friends, old Zur took over the newsstand sale of their
publication on a commission basis. He even displayed the
magazine in his shop window. To his astonishment, the
whole of the first issue was sold out. Four more followed.
By the end of the summer, the boys&#8217; income, after
deduction of expenses and commissions, amounted to
roughly $50. The children gave this money&mdash;not without
some regret, to be truthful&mdash;to the local fishermen
whose boats had been shattered against the rocks of the
coast by a passing hurricane.</p>
<p>Inspired by the unexpected success of their first
year&#8217;s operations, the editorial staff resumed publication
in the following summer at that same resort. It proved
even more interesting. It contained interviews with fishermen
and lobstermen and a story told by an old captain
of a fishing schooner, who was spending his declining
years in a dilapidated shack by the seashore. That huge,
hoarse, bearded giant was always drunk. But in his rare
moments of sobriety he was kind, used to give candy
to the children and nobody could tell fascinating sea
adventure stories better than he did. Mikey managed
to catch him in such a mood and the magazine was
adorned, as a result, with a powerful story by the old
captain about a hurricane that threw ships around like
bits of paper and about the rescue of a beautiful lady
passenger who had been thrown into the ocean by the
roaring gale, by the captain himself, who saved her out
of the waves at the risk of his own life.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The children&#8217;s hobby, which so clearly demonstrated
their propensity toward journalism, greatly interested
us. During our visits with various American families
our attention had been drawn more than once to this good
trait&mdash;if indeed it is not a tradition&mdash;which makes the
children familiarize themselves with the profession of
their father, or their grandfather, or some close relative.
In the apartment of an auto-mechanic we saw a
small lathe and a block on which a little fellow was
filing something. In the family of a musician, little
girls played on the violin. The little son of a well-known
Hollywood scenario-creator told us excitedly how he and
his little brothers and sisters were making a film. A
child&#8217;s game gradually develops into an absorbing interest,
and maybe in these games which are treated seriously,
not only by the children but as a rule by the adults
too, the seed of his future profession is planted in the
child&#8217;s brain.</p>
<p>I expressed the wish to become a subscriber to the
<i>Green Spring-Menemsha Gazette</i> for a full year and took
out a $5 bill. The editor and the publisher exchanged
glances. They obviously wished to get a foreign subscriber.
But what if this should create trouble of some
kind? Were they entitled to mail their magazine abroad,
and moreover, to a country like the USSR? What would
their father and mother say? And how would Mr. John
Foster Dulles react?</p>
<div class='figright' style='width:250px'>

<img src='images/082.png' alt='Green Spring-Menemsha Gazette' title='' width='250' height='160' />
<br />
</div>
<p>David carefully pushed the bill away, back to my
end of the table. I, of course, felt offended. Could it
be that I had no right to subscribe to an American magazine?
Why such discrimination? The editor whispered
something to the publisher who ran out of the room
and came back dragging Michael senior in once more.
The father laughed. He apparently had no objection
to the mailing abroad of the magazine which was being
published under his sponsorship. All the periodical publications
of good standing always have foreign subscribers.
However, Michael senior had objections against
any monetary transaction with countries abroad. It was
agreed that the subscription would be handled on a
clearing basis: the <i>Green Spring-Menemsha Gazette</i>
would be mailed to the USSR in exchange for our children&#8217;s
magazine <i>The Pioneer</i>. We shook hands on this
transaction, concluded to the mutual satisfaction of the
&#8220;high contracting parties.&#8221;</p>
<p>When we returned to the living room, the debate
about the freedom of the press was still continuing.
But the two sides had exchanged places. Gribatchov was
the one who led the attack now; the idea of exchanging
articles with <i>The New Republic</i> had gradually excited
him. Publisher Harrison, on the contrary, was taking
a defensive stand: he was already foreseeing numerous
difficulties obstructing the materialization of his
project. The unionist leader was sitting on the sofa
next to them. He was a tall man with a pale face with
an ironical expression, and he was gently mocking the
discomfited publisher. &#8220;Really, why shouldn&#8217;t there be
an exchange of articles with a Russian paper?&#8221;</p>
<p>So finally they came to no conclusion at all.</p>
<p>We were taking our seats in the car when David
manfully shook hands with me and suddenly asked:
&#8220;Maybe you will write from Moscow a contribution for
publication in <i>The Green Spring-Menemsha Gazette</i>?
Our magazine will gladly publish it, I can promise you.&#8221;</p>
<p>My negotiations with the editors of the <i>Gazette</i> appeared
to be more fruitful than the ones Gribatchov
had had with <i>The New Republic</i>.</p>

<p class='center'>JULY 16, 1956</p>
<h3>Editors&#8217; Note:</h3>
<p>There are, of course, some errors in Mr. Polevoy&#8217;s
story. Many are due, as he notes, to the fact that
parts of the conversation were conducted through
dramatic gesticulations and incoherent sounds. Bill Seward,
the youthful proprietor of Menemsha&#8217;s post office
and store, for example, may not recognize himself as
the ancient Mr. Zur, and the author of Cassandra Bobble,
a fictional caricature of society columnists, will be surprised
to see her creation re-emerge in Russian as Xandra
Babel the neighbor&#8217;s girl reporter. More substantial, in
the editor&#8217;s opinion, is his view that it was Mr. Gribatchov
and not Mr. Harrison who doubted the practicality
of an exchange of articles. And yet as many errors of
detail and interpretation would no doubt be found
were we to describe an evening spent in Mr. Polevoy&#8217;s
villa outside Moscow. As far as the general tone of Mr.
Polevoy&#8217;s account is concerned we cannot complain.</p>
<p>Mr. Polevoy, after all, is describing an evening in the
home of an opponent of the political administration in
power. Soviet readers learn that it is a comfortable place,
lived in by a family substantially free from fear. The
author refers in a mocking way to the shadow of John
Foster Dulles and mentions the reluctance of the boys
to take his $5 (the reason, lost in translation, was that
they would not be publishing their paper in 1956). But
just as Mr. Polevoy seems about to conclude with a political
moral, he demolishes this traditional ending in
favor of the truth. For the discussion which Mr. Polevoy
describes ended with a whispered aside which the host
found startling. &#8220;We will put you on the subscriber&#8217;s
list to <i>The Pioneer</i>!&#8221; Mr. Polevoy had roared to the boys;
then he drew their father aside: &#8220;That is, if it will not
hurt you,&#8221; he whispered. The host laughed and explained
that he and his sons were free citizens, able to
read whatever they pleased and happy to receive literature
from other lands. It seems gratifying to us that this
small but memorable incident has found its way into the
Soviet press.</p>
